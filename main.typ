#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function such that
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) = U(f, P, [a, b]) $
  for some partition $P$ of $[a, b]$. Prove that $f$ is constant on $[a, b]$.
]

#solution[
  Suppose $P$ is the partition $a = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = b$, then
  $
    0 = U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) = sum_(j = 1)^n (x_j - x_(j-1))
    (sup_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f - inf_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f)
  $

  Then, it becomes trivial that we must have
  $ sup_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f - inf_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f = 0, forall j = 1, ..., n $

  This is equivalent to the fact that $f$ is constant on $[x_(j-1), x_j]$, for
  all $j = 1, ..., n$. Hence $f$ is constant on $[a, b]$.

#problem[
  Suppose $a <= s < t <= b$. Define $f: [a, b] -> RR$ by
  $ f(x) = cases(1 "if" s < x < t,  0 "otherwise") $. Prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable on $[a, b]$, and that $integral_a^b f = t - s$.
]

#solution[
  Let $P_epsilon$ be the partition $a, s + epsilon, t - epsilon, b$ for some
  sufficiently small $epsilon > 0$ such that $a < s + epsilon < t - epsilon < b$.

  It is trivial to see that:
  $
    L(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) &= t - s - 2epsilon, \
    "and" U(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) &= t - s + 2epsilon
  $

  Now, consider an arbitrary partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have:
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) = t - s + 2epsilon $

  Letting $epsilon$ go to zero and taking the supremum of the left hand side, we
  have:
  $ sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]) <= t - s $

  But, $L(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) = t - s - 2epsilon$, which converges to $t - s$
  as $epsilon$ goes to zero. Hence, equality must hold: $sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]) = t - s$.

  Similarly, it is true that $inf_P U(f, P, [a, b]) = t - s$. Hence, $L(f, [a,
  b]) = U(f, [a, b]) = t - s$, QED.

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function. Prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable if and only if for each $epsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$
  of $[a, b]$ such that
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $
]

#solution[
  If $f$ is Riemann integrable, then denote $I = integral_a^b f$. Then,
  $ I = inf_P U(f, P, [a, b]) - sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]), $
  which means for every $epsilon' > 0$, there exists partitions $P_1, P_2$ such
  that
  $ U(f, P_1, [a, b]) <= I + epsilon' "and" L(f, P_2, [a, b]) >= I - epsilon'. $

  Let $P$ be the combination of the two partitions, then:
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) <= I + epsilon' "and" L(f, P, [a, b]) >= I - epsilon. $

  Hence, $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) <= 2epsilon'$, so by taking $epsilon' =
  1/2 epsilon$, we have $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon$.

  Now, assuming the opposite, suppose for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists a
  partition $P$ such that $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon$. From
  this, we must have $U(f, [a, b]) - L(f, [a, b]) < epsilon$ for every $epsilon
  > 0$. This can only hold if the left hand side expression is 0, which means
  that $f$ is Riemann integrable.

#problem[
  Suppose $f, g: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that $f + g$ is also
  Riemann integrable and
  $ integral_a^b (f + g) = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b g $
]

#solution[
  Let $P$ be a partition of $[a, b]$, then
  $
    L(f + g, P, [a, b]) >= L(f, P, [a, b]) + L(g, P, [a, b]) >= L(f, [a, b]) +
    L(g, [a, b]), \
    "and" U(f + g, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) + U(g, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, [a,
        b]) + U(g, [a, b])
  $

  Taking the infimum/supremum of the left hand sides yields
  $
    L(f + g, [a, b]) >= L(f, [a, b]) + L(g, [a, b]) = U(f, [a, b]) + U(g, [a,
        b]) >= U(f + g, [a, b])
  $
  The middle equality holds since $f$ and $g$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.
  Now, we have $L(f+g, [a, b]) >= U(f+g, [a, b])$, which must be an equality,
  so $f+g$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and
  $ integral_a^b (f + g) = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b g $
  holds.

#problem[
  Suppose $f, g: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that $f - g$ is also
  Riemann integrable and
  $ integral_a^b (f - g) = integral_a^b f - integral_a^b g $
]

#solution[
  For every partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have:
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) = -U(-f, P, [a, b]) "and" U(f, P, [a, b]) = -L(-f, P, [a, b]) $
  From this, it should be trivial to solve this problem.

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Suppose $g: [a, b] -> RR$ is
  a function such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all except finitely many $x in [a, b]$.
  Prove that $g$ is also Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and
  $ integral_a^b g = integral_a^b f $
]

#solution[
  We will concern ourselves with the easy case where $f(x) = 0$ for all $x in
  [a, b]$. Then, if $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n$ are the only values of $x$ such that
  $g(x_i) != 0, forall i = 1, ..., n$, then the partition $P_epsilon$ with $a < x_1 -
  epsilon < x_1 + epsilon < x_2 - epsilon < x_2 + epsilon < ... < x_n - epsilon
  < x_n + epsilon < b$ will yields the following result
  $
    U(f, P, [a, b]) &= 2epsilon sum_(i = 1)^n max{0, g(x_i)}, \
    "and" L(f, P, [a, b]) &= 2epsilon sum_(i = 1)^n min{0, g(x_i)}.
  $
  Letting $epsilon -> 0$ shows that $U(f, [a, b]) <= 0 <= L(f, [a, b])$, so we
  must have $ integral_a^b g = 0 $.

  Back to the general case, since the function $g - f$ satisfies the conditions
  of $g$ as above, $g - f$ must be Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$, and that
  $integral_a^b (g - f) = 0$. Hence, $g$, the sum of two Riemann integrable
  functions $f$ and $g-f$, must also be Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$, and
  $ integral_a^b g = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b (g - f) = integral_a^b f $
]

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function. For $n in ZZ^+$, let $P_n$
  denote the partition that divides $[a, b]$ into $2^n$ intervals of equal size.
  Prove that
  $
    L(f, [a, b]) = lim_(n -> infinity) L(f, P_n, [a, b]) "and" U(f, [a, b]) =
    lim_(n -> infinity) U(f, P_n, [a, b]).
  $
]

#solution[
  The sequence $l_n = L(f, P_n, [a, b])$ is non-decreasing, so $lim_(n -> infinity)
   L(f, P_n, [a, b])$ definitely exists. Denote this limit as $L$, so $L$ must
  be at least as large as $L(f, [a, b])$. Our aim is to prove that equality
  actually holds here.

  For every partition $Q$ of $[a, b]$, denote $Q_n$ as the combination of $P_n$
  and $Q$. Then,
  $ L(f, [a, b]) = L(f, Q, [a, b]) <= L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) $

  We will establish an upper bound for $L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b])$.
  Note that these two only differs at most $m$ elements (where $m$ is the
  number of partition points (excluding $a$ and $b$) of $Q$), so this difference
  is basically $O(m w delta)$, where $w$ is the maximum width of a partitioned
  interval (which is $(b-a)/2^n)$, $delta$ is the maximum difference between two
  values of $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ for some $x, y in [a, b]$.

  $m$ is bounded (since $Q$ stays constant), $delta$ is also bounded by
  $sup_[a, b] f  - inf_[a, b] f$ (which is finite since $f$ is bounded) while
  $w -> 0$. Hence, this big-O term converges to $0$ as $n -> infinity$. This
  big-O thingy is not really rigorous, but it should be trivial to make it
  rigorous from here. Anyways, since $L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b]) ->
  0$, so does $L(f, P_n, [a, b]) - L(f, [a, b])$. Hence,

  $ lim_(n -> infinity) L(f, P_n, [a, b]) = L(f, [a, b]). $

  Needless to say, the other conclusion can be proven similarly.

  This follows the same logic as the previous exercise. Note that since $f$ is
  Riemann integrable, it must also be bounded by definition.

  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that if $c, d in RR$

]

#solution[
  For every $epsilon > 0$, there exists a partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ such that
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $

  Adding the points $c$ and $d$ to $P$ yields a new partition $P'$ of $[a, b]$,
  which must satisfy
  $ U(f, P', [a, b]) - L(f, P', [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $

  From the definition of lower and upper Riemann sums, we must have the
  following
  $
    U(f, P'', [c, d]) - L(f, P'', [c, d]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) <
    epsilon,

  if these conditions hold, then:
  $
    integral_a^b f = integral_a^c f + integral_c^b f.
  $
]

#solution[
  Using the previous exercise, it should be trivial to prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable on $[a, c]$ and $[c, b]$ if $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.

  Now, if $f$ is Riemann integrable on the two intervals, for any $epsilon > 0$,
  there exists partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ such that:

  $
    I_1 - epsilon < L(f, P_1, [a, c]) <= U(f, P_1, [a, c]) < I_1 + epsilon, \
    "and" I_2 - epsilon < L(f, P_2, [c, b]) <= U(f, P_2, [c, b]) < I_2 + epsilon,
  $
  where $I_1 = integral_a^c f$ and $I_2 = integral_c^b f$.

  Then, the combined partition $P$ of $P_1$ and $P_2$ on $[a, b]$ must satisfy
  $ I_1 + I_2 - 2epsilon < L(f, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) < I_1 + I_2 + 2epsilon $

  From this it is trivial to conclude the exercise.

  - $f$ is left-continuous at $t = a$: This is equivalent to proving

]

#solution[
  For any interval $I$, we have
  $ 0 <= sup_I |f| - inf_I |f| <= sup_I f - inf_I f, $
  therefore, for every partitions $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have
  $ U(|f|, P, [a, b]) - L(|f|, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]). $
  Using the epsilon thing, we can see that $|f|$ is Riemann integrable.

  To prove the inequality, it suffices to note that $|f| plus.minus f$ is always
  non-negative, and therefore have non-negative Riemann integrals.
  Hence, $ integral_a^b |f| >= max{integral_a^b (|f| - f) + integral_a^b f,
  integral_a^b (f + |f|) - integral_a^b f} >= abs(integral_a^b f) $.

  Consider the uniform partition $P_n$ of $[a, b]$ into $N = 2^n$ subintervals, then

  Hence,
  $ U(f, P_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b]) = (f(b) - f(a)) / N -> 0, $

    integral_a^b f = lim_(n -> infinity) integral_a^b f_n.

#solution[
  $f_n$ converging to $f$ uniformly means
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) sup_[a, b] |f - f_n| = 0 $

  Let $u_n = sup_[a, b] |f-f_n|$, then for any interval $[c, d] subset.eq [a,
  b]$, if $x_0$ is the value of $x in [c, d]$ such that $f (x_0) = sup_[c, d] f$,
  we must have:
  $
    abs(sup_[c, d] f - sup_[c, d] f_n) <= abs(f(x_0) - f_n (x_0)) + abs(f_n (x_0)
    - sup_[c, d] f_n) <= u_n + sup_[c, d] f - inf_[c, d] f
  $
  Then, for every partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ into $a = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n =
  b$, we have
  $
    abs(U(f, P, [a, b]) - U(f_n, P, [a, b])) &= abs(sum_(j = 1)^n (x_j -
    x_(j-1)) (sup_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f_n - sup([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f)) \
    &<= sum_(j = 1)^n (x_j - x_(j-1)) (u_n + sup_[a, b] f - inf_[a, b] f) \
    &<= (b - a) u_n + (U(f_n, P, [a, b]) - L(f_n, P, [a, b])).

  Similarly, we have:
  $
    abs(L(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f_n, P, [a, b])) <= (b - a) u_n + (U(f, P, [a,

  $

  The right hand side expression can be made arbitrarily small by choosing $n$
  such that $u_n <= epsilon/(5(b-a))$ and $P$ such that $U(f_n, P, [a, b]) -
  L(f_n, P, [a, b]) <= epsilon/(5(b-a))$. QED.

#solution[
  It is trivial to see $L(f, [0, 1]) = 0$. Now it suffices to prove that $U(f,
  [0, 1]) = 0$.

  Consider the uniform partition $P$ that divides $[0, 1]$ into $n(n-1) + 2$
  equal subintervals. Then, since every rational number lies in at most 2
  subintervals, we must have the following:
  $
    U(f, P, [0, 1]) <= 2 / (n(n-1) + 2) sum_(k = 1)^(n(n-1) / 2+1) f(q_k),
  $
  where $q_1, q_2, ...$ is an enumeration of the rationals in $[0, 1]$,
  ordered by $f(q_1) < f(q_2) < ...$. In fact, by noting that $q_1 = 1, q_2 =
  1/2, q_3 = 1/3, q_4 = 2/3, ...$ (here, if $f(p) = f(q)$ then we fallback to
  default ordering to enumerate $p$ and $q$), it is possible to evaluate the sum as
  $ sum_(k = 1)^(n(n-1) / 2+1) f(q_k) = 1 + sum_(k = 2)^n (k - 1) / k <= n $

  Hence, $U(f, [0, 1]) <= U(f, P, [0, 1]) <= (2n)/(n(n-1) + 2) -> 0$ as $n ->

    integral_(x_n)^(x_n + r_n) (x-x_n) / r_n^2 dif x = 1,
  $
  so $lim_(n -> infinity) integral_0^1 f_n = 1$.

  However, we can pick $r_n$ and $x_n$ such that $f(x) = lim_(n -> infinity) f_n
  (x) = 0$ for all $x in [0, 1]$. In order to do so, we need to have the
  following:

  $
    forall x in [0, 1], exists N in ZZ^+: x in.not (x_n - r_n, x_n + r_n),
    forall n > N
  $

  We will iteratively construct $x_n$ and $r_n$ as follows.

  1. Divides $[0, 1]$ into two equal subintervals $(0, 1/2)$ and $(1/2, 1)$.
    Then, let $(x_1 - r_1, x_1 + r_1) = (0, 1/2)$, i.e. $x_1 = 1/4$ and $r_1 = 1/4$.
  2. For every $x in [0, 1/2]$, we will let $N = 1$, which means that $(x_n
    - r_n, x_n + r_n) subset.eq (1/2, 1)$ for all $n > 1$. The idea is very
    simple: we just chop that interval into two subintervals again: $(x_2-r_2,
    x_2+r_2) = [1/2, 3/4]$, and $(x_n-r_n, x_n+r_n) subset.eq [3/4, 1]$ for
    all $n > 2$. Then, $x_2 = 5/8$ and $r_2 = 1/8$.
  3. Continue the steps above to infinity.

  More rigorously, we can define $x_n$ and $r_n$ explicitly as follows:
  $ r_n = 1 / 2^(n + 1) "and" x_n = 1 - 3 / 2^(n + 1). $

  Then, for every $x in [0, 1)$ ($x = 1$ does not lie on any $[x_n - r_n,
  x_n + r_n]$, so we can ignore this case), there exists some $N$ such that
  $ 1 / 2^N <= 1 - x < 1 / 2^(N - 1). $
  So if,
  $
    &x in (x_n - r_n, x_n + r_n) = (1 - 1 / 2^(n - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^n) \
    &=> (1 - 1 / 2^(N - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^N] sect (1 - 1 / 2^(n - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^n) !=
    emptyset \
    &=> N = n
  $

  Hence, for every $n > N$, $x$ can not belong to $(x_n - r_n, x_n + r_n)$,
  which is equivalent to $f_n (x) = 0, forall n > N$. Hence, $f(x) = 0$ for all
  $x in [0, 1]$, and therefore
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) integral_0^1 f_n = 1 != 0 = integral_0^1 f. $

  The inequality is equivalent to $|A| + |B without A| >= |B|$, which is clearly
  true due to subadditivity.

#problem[
  Suppose $F$ is a subset of $RR$ with the property that every open cover of $F$
  has a finite subcover. Prove that $F$ is closed and bounded.
]

#solution[
  Consider the following open cover of $RR$ (and therefore $F$):
  $ F subset.eq RR = union.big_(n in ZZ^+) (-n, n). $
  Since $F$ has a finite subcover, denoted $(-n_1, n_1), (-n_2, n_2), ...,
  (-n_k, n_k)$, it must be contained in $(-max_(i = 1, ..., k) n_i, max_(i = 1,
  ..., k) n_i)$. Hence, $F$ is bounded.

  Denote $d(x, y) = |x - y|$ as the distance between two real numbers $x$ and
  $y$#footnote[This is to make it so that this argument generalizes well to
  higher-dimensional spaces (and Hausdorff topological spaces in general)],
  $B(x, r) = (x-r, x+r)$ as the open ball centered at $x$ with radius $r$.

  Consider an arbitrary $x_0 in RR without F$, then
  $ cal(C) = {B(x, 1 / 2 d(x, x_0)) | x in C} $
  is an open cover of $F$. Hence, there exists finitely many $x_1, x_2, ...,
  x_n$ such that $ F subset.eq union.big_(k = 1)^n B(x_k, 1/2 d(x_k, x_0)). $

  Now, consider $ N = B(x_0, 1/2 min_(k = 1, 2, ...n) d(x_k, x_0)), $
  $N$ clearly does not intersect any of $B(x_k, 1/2 d(x_k, x_0))$, so $N$ does
  not contain any element in $F$, i.e. $N subset.eq RR without F$.

  Hence, $RR without F$ is open, i.e. $F$ is closed.

#solution[
  Let $A'$ be the set of closed and bounded sets in $A$ and pick any $B in A'$.
  This invokes the Axiom of Choice.

  We have $sect.big_(F in A without {B}) F sect B = diameter$, so
  $
    B subset.eq RR without sect.big_(F in A without {B}) F = union.big_(F in A
    without B) (RR without F).
  $

  Here, we have an open cover of closed and bounded $B$, so there must exists
  finitely many $F_1, F_2, ..., F_n$ such that

  $ B subset.eq union.big_(k = 1)^n (RR without F_k). $

  $|(a, b) union (c, d)| = b - a + d - c$ if and only if $(a, b) sect (c, d) =
  diameter$.
]

#solution[
  If $(a, b) sect (c, d) = diameter$, then WLOG assuming $a < b < c < d$, and
  then $ |(a, b)| + |(c, d)| >= |(a, b) union (c, d)| >= |(a, d) without (b,
  c)|, $ and equivalently
  $ b - a + d - c >= |(a, b) union (c, d)| >= d - a - c + b. $
  This means $|(a, b) union (c, d)| = b - a + d - c$.

  Now, if $|(a, b) union (c, d)| = b - a + d - c = |(a, b)| + |(c, d)|$, then we
  must have $|(a, b) sect (c, d)| = 0$. The intersection of two open interval
  is either empty, or another open interval (with non-zero outer measure).
  Hence, it must be the case that $(a, b) sect (c, d) = diameter$.

#problem[
  Prove that if $A subset.eq RR$ and $t > 0$ then $|A| = |A sect (-t, t)| + |A
  sect (RR without (-t, t))|$.
]

#solution[
  For every open interval $I = (c, d)$,
  - $(c, d) sect (-t, t)$ is an open interval $(max{c, -t}, min{d, t})$. Denote
    this interval as $alpha(I)$.
  - For every $epsilon > 0$,
    $
      (c, d) sect (RR without (-t, t)) &= ((c, d) sect (-infinity, -t]) union ((c,
          d) sect [t, infinity))\
      &subset.eq ((c, d) sect (-infinity, -t)) union ((c,
          d) sect (t, infinity)) union {-t, t}\
      &subset.eq (c, min{d, -t}) union (max{c, t}, d) union {-t, t}.
    $
    Denote $beta(I) = (c, min{d, -t})$ and $ gamma(I) = (max{c, t}, d)$.

  It is trivial to see that $ell(I) = ell(alpha(I)) + ell(beta(I)) +
  ell(gamma(I))$, and if $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval cover of $A$, the
  following are covers of $A sect (-t, t)$ and $A sect (RR without (-t, t))$
  respectively:
  - $S = {alpha(I_1), alpha(I_2), ...}$ of $A sect (-t, t)$.
  - $T = {(t-epsilon, t+epsilon), (-t-epsilon, -t+epsilon), beta(I_1), beta(I_2),
  ..., gamma(I_1), gamma(I_2), ...}$ of $A sect (RR without (-t, t))$.

  We have:
  $
    sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) &= (sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(alpha(I_n))) +
    (sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(beta(I_n, epsilon)) + sum_(n=1)^infinity
      ell(gamma(I_n, epsilon))) \
    &= sum_(I in S) ell(I) + sum_(I in T) ell(I) - 4 epsilon \
    &>= |A sect (-t, t)| + |A sect (RR without (-t, t))| - 4epsilon.
  $

  Letting $epsilon -> 0$ and taking the infimum of left hand side, it must be
  the case that $|A| >= |A sect (-t, t)| + |A sect (RR without (-t, t))|$.
  Combining this with subadditivity yields the desired result.
]

#problem[
  Prove that $|A| = lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect (-t, t)|$ for all $A subset.eq
  RR$.
] <outer-measure-limit>

#solution[
  We consider the following two cases:

  - If $|A| < +infinity$, then the equality is equivalent to $lim_(t ->
    infinity) |A without (-t, t)| = 0$. This limit definitely exists and is
    non-negative due to the fact that $f(t) = |A without (-t, t)|$ is decreasing
    and non-negative.

    Assuming that this limit is positive, i.e. there exists some $epsilon, t_0 > 0$
    such that $forall t > t_0, |A without (-t, t)| > epsilon$. This is equivalent to
    the fact that if $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval cover of $A without (-t,
    t)$, then $sum_(k = 1)^infinity ell(I_k) > epsilon$.

    Furthermore, if this series converges to some $S < +infinity$, then there
    exists some $k_0$ such that $sum_(k=1)^k_0 ell(I_k) > L - epsilon$ and
    therefore $sum_(k=k_0+1)^infinity ell(I_k) < epsilon$. If we take

    $ t' = max{t, max_(1 <= k <= k_0) (max {-inf I_k, sup I_k})}, $

    then $I_(k_0+1), I_(k_0+2), ...$ is an open interval cover of $A without (-t',
    t')$, but $sum_(k=k_0+1)^infinity ell(I_k) < epsilon$, a contradiction. Hence,
    it must be the case that $sum_(k=1)^infinity ell(I_k) = +infinity$.

    However, this means that $|A|$ must be equal to $+infinity$, a
    contradiction.

  - If $|A| = +infinity$, then we have to prove $lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect
    (-t, t)| = +infinity$. This limit exists due to monotonicity, so we assume
    the limit is finite, i.e. there exists some $M > 0$ such that $M > |A sect
    (-t, t)|$ for all $t in RR$.

    #lemma[
      If $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval partition of $RR without C$, where
      $C$ is a countable set, then for all $A subset.eq RR$, $ |A| = sum_(k =
      1)^infinity |A sect I_k|. $
    ] <outer-measure-lemma>

    #proof[
      We trivially have $|A| <= sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A sect I_k|$ due to
      subadditivity. Consider an arbitrary open interval cover $J_1, J_2, ...$
      of $A$, then for every $k in NN$, $J_1 sect I_k, J_2 sect I_k, ...$ is an
      interval of $A sect I_k$, so it must be the case that

      $ |A sect I_k| <= sum_(j = 1)^infinity ell(J_j sect I_k). $

      Hence,

      $
        sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A sect I_k| <= sum_(k = 1)^infinity sum_(j =
        1)^infinity ell(J_j sect I_k) = sum_(j = 1)^infinity ell(J_j),
      $

      where the last equality holds due to the fact that $I_1, I_2, ...$ is a
      partition of $RR without C$.

      However, by the definition of the outer measure, $sum_(j = 1)^infinity
      ell(J_j) <= |A|$, so equality must hold: $|A| = sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A
      sect I_k|$.
    ]

    Now, consider the following open interval partition of $RR without ZZ$:
    $ (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 2), (-2, -1), ..., $
    i.e. $I_k = (pi(k), pi(k) + 1)$, where $pi$ denotes some bijection from
    $NN$ to $ZZ$.

    Then, we have $|A sect (-t, t)| = sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t,
    t)|$. Hence, $ lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect (-t, t)| = lim_(t -> infinity)
    sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t, t)| < M. $

    However, for every $t in ZZ$, we have:

    $
      sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t, t)| = sum_(k = -t)^(t - 1) |A
      sect (k, k + 1)|.
    $

    So,

    $ sum_(k = -infinity)^infinity |A sect (k, k + 1)| < M. $

    Applying the lemma again, we have $|A| = sum_(k = -infinity)^infinity |A
    sect (k, k + 1)|$. Hence, $|A| < M$, a contradiction with $|A| = +infinity$.

    a rational number. But since the complement of $F$ contains all rational
    numbers, $I$ must not be fully contained in $F$, a contradiction.

    $
      |RR without F| <= sum_(k = 1)^infinity ell((r_k - 1/2^k, r_k + 1/2^k)) +

  We will construct this set step-by-step.

  The set of reals with decimal expansion having the digit $5$ appearing right
  after the decimal place is,

  $ S(1) = union.big_(k in ZZ) [k + 0.5, k + 0.6]. $

  Here, for simplicity, we consider $0.6 = 0.59999...$ to be a part of $S(1)$.

  Then, this result can be trivially generalized: the set of reals with decimal
  expansion having the digit $5$ appearing at the $k$-th position after the
  decimal place is $S(k) = 10^(-k) S(1)$.

  Now, if $r$ is a real number with finitely many 5's in its decimal expansion,
  then there exists some natural number $N$ such that $r in.not S(k)$ for all $k
  > N$. Hence, the set of all such $r$ must be,

  $ T = union.big_(N in NN) (RR without union.big_(k > N) S(k)). $

  The complement of $T$ is the set we need to construct: the set of real numbers
  that have a decimal expansion with the digit 5 appearing infinitely often.

  complement and (countably infinite) union operation, so the complement of $T$

  #lemma[
    A uncountable subset $S$ of $RR$ can always be partitioned into two
    uncountable subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $sup A <= inf B$.
  ]

  #proof[
    Define $M = {x in R : S sect (-infinity, x) "is countable" }$ and $N =
    {x in R : S sect (x, infinity) "is countable" }$.

    If $M sect N$ has some element $u$, then $S subset.eq (S sect (-infinity, u)) union
    (S sect (u, infinity)) union {u}$ must be countable, a contradiction.
    However, it can be proven that $m = sup M in M$ by writing

    $
      S sect (-infinity, m) = union.big_(k = 1)^infinity (S sect (-infinity, m -
          1 / k)),
    $
    where we can be sure that $m - epsilon in S$ for all $epsilon > 0$.

    The right-hand-side expression is the countable union of countable sets, so
    $S sect (-infinity, m)$ must be countable as well. Similarly, we can prove
    that $n = inf N in N$.

    Now, if $m < n$, then we can pick $r = (m + n)/2 in RR without M without N$,
    and define $A = S sect (-infinity, r)$, $B = S sect [r, infinity)$.

    Otherwise, if $m >= n$, then $M sect N$ is nonempty, a contradiction.
  ]

  Using the lemma, we can see that if $f(X)$ is uncountable, we can partition it
  into two uncountable subsets $A$ and $B$. Then, $f^(-1)(A)$ and $f^(-1)(B)$
  are both uncountable, so $f$ is not measurable, a contradiction.

  Hence, $f(X)$ must be countable, i.e. there exists a partition $X_1, X_2, ...
  $ of $X$ such that $f(X_i) = {y_i}$ are singletons and $y_i != y_j$ for all $i
  != j$.

  Since $f^(-1)({y_i}) = X_i$, all $X_i$ must be countable or have a countable
  complement (cocountable). If there are two cocountable sets $X_1$ and $X_2$
  (without loss of generality, and we assume $y_1 < y_2$ here),
  then $f^(-1)((-infinity, (y_1+y_2)/2)) supset.eq X_1$ and
  $f^(-1)(((y_1+y_2)/2, infinity)) supset.eq X_2$, which are both uncountable,
  so none of the preimages can be in the $Sc$. Hence,

  $ f "is non-constant on a countable set." $

  We can trivially verify that all $f$ satisfying the above property is
  $Sc$-measurable.

#solution[
  Define a mapping $mu$ as follows:

  Since $f$ is increasing, for every $x_0 in B$, there exists left and right
  limits:
  $
    f^+(x) = lim_(x -> x_0^+) f(x) = inf f((x, +infinity)), f^-(x) = lim_(x ->
    x_0^-) f(x) = sup f((-infinity, x)).
  $

  $f$ is discontinuous at $x$ if and only if $f^+(x) > f^-(x)$. Then, there
  exists rationals $q$ in $(f^-(x), f^+(x))$. For each such $q$, we define
  $mu(q) = x$.

  For every unmarked $q$, we let $mu(q)$ be some undefined value, e.g.
  $diameter$. We can be sure that a rational $q$ is never marked twice, since
  the intervals $(f^-(x), f^+(x))$ does not intersect. Then, $mu$ is an
  surjective#footnote[This statement might not be true if there is no $q$ that
  maps to $diameter$ but this is just a small and easily fixable detail.]
  mapping from $QQ$ to $D union {diameter}$, where $D$ is the set of
  discontinuities of $f$.

  Hence, it must be the case that $D$ is countable.

    The only difference between the three cases is the neighborhood of $f(x)$ in

    one of its endpoint, while the third case yields a singleton neighborhood.

  Suppose $f: RR -> RR$ is a strictly increasing function and $B subset.eq RR$

#solution[
  Let $Sc = {B subset.eq RR: f(B) "is a Borel set"}$. Proving $Sc$ is a
  $sigma$-algebra containing all open sets reduces to proving the following:

  #lemma[If $E subset.eq RR$ is open, than $f(E)$ is a Borel set.]

  #proof[
    $E$ can be written as the disjoint union of countably many open intervals
    $I_k$, so this effectively reduces the problem to the case where $E = (a,
    b)$ for some $a, b in RR$.

    Denote $Y = RR without f((a, b))$. Define an equivalent relation $tilde$ as
    $x tilde y <==> [x, y] subset.eq Y$. Then, the equivalent classes $C_alpha$,
    $alpha in A$ must be disjoint intervals. If some interval $C_alpha = {y}$ is
    degenerate (a singleton), then there are sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ such
    that:
    - $f(a_n)$ is strictly increasing and have a upper bound of $y$.
    - $f(b_n)$ is strictly decreasing and have a upper bound of $y$.

    Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $a_n$ and $b_n$ are monotonic sequences
    ($a_n$ strictly increasing, $b_n$ strictly decreasing), and therefore they
    both converges at some $u = lim a_n$ and $v = lim b_n$. Then, $f(u) >= y >=
    f(v)$, so it must be the case that $u = v$ and $f(u) = y$, which contradicts
    $y in RR without f((a, b))$.

    Hence, $Y$ can be partitioned into disjoint non-degenerate intervals, and
    using the rational number trick, we can prove that the number of those
    intervals must be countably infinite at most, so $Y$ turns out to be a Borel
    set. Hence, $f((a, b))$ is also a Borel set.

#solution[
  This is a direct consequence of the fact that $sum_(r in U) f(r) < infinity$
  for some $f: U -> (0, infinity)$ can only hold when $U$ is countable.

  The infinite sum is defined as
  $
    sum_(r in U) f(r) = sup_(U' subset.eq U\
    U' "countable") sum_(r in U') f(r).
  $

  Consider the set $U(epsilon) = {r in U: f(r) > epsilon}$. If there exists some
  $epsilon > 0$ such that $U(epsilon)$ is infinite, then

  $ sum_(r in U) f(r) >= sum_(r in U'') f(r) = infinity, $

  $ U' = union.big_(n in ZZ^+) U(1 / n), $

  Let $A$ be any bounded non-Lebesgue-measurable set. Then there exists some

  Once again, let $V$ be any bounded non-Lebesgue-measurable set. Assuming $V$
  is bounded in $(0, 1)$, and there exists some $epsilon > 0$ such that $|G

  Then, consider the set $A = union.big_(n in ZZ) (V + n)$. Any open
  superset $G$ of $A$ can be divided up into multiple $G_k = G sect (k, k + 1)
  supset.eq V + k, k in ZZ$
  that does not intersect any of $V + n$ with $k != n$. Hence, we can see
  that $G_k$ is an open set that contains $V + k$, so it must hold that:
  $ |G_k without (V + k)| >= epsilon. $

  Finally, we have
  $
    |G without A| = abs(union.big_(n in ZZ) (G_k without (V + k)))

  Here, we get around the subadditivity problem by considering that $G_k without

#solution[
  + Let $S = union.big_(I in cal(C)) I$ be such a set, where $cal(C)$ is a
    collection of nontrivial intervals.

    #let int(x) = [Int #x]
    Denote $int(X)$ as the interior of the set $X$, then we know that there
    exists some countable $cal(C') subset.eq cal(C)$ such that
    $ S' = union.big_(I in cal(C)) int(I) = union.big_(I in cal(C')) int(I), $
    from Theorem 0.59 of the MIRA supplement.

    Hence, our concern shifts to the boundary of the intervals in $cal(C)$.
    Without loss of generality, we will consider the right endpoints $x in S
    without S'$. Then, there has to be some $(alpha, x] in cal(C)$ or $[alpha, x] in
    cal(C)$ for some $alpha$ (the left endpoint and whether $alpha$ is contained
    in this range does not matter). We can get over the axiom of choice by
    imposing some sort of total ordering on the set $cal(C)$. Denote this
    interval as $I(x)$.

    Now, we can prove that $int(I(x)) sect int(I(y)) = diameter$ for all $x, y in S
    without S', x != y$. Otherwise, then without loss of generality, assuming
    that $int(I(x)) = (alpha, x), I(y) = (beta, y), x < y$, it must be the case that
    $beta < x < y$, so $x in int(I(y)) subset.eq S'$, a contradiction.

    Since $int(I(x))$'es are pairwise disjoint, we can establish a mapping from
    a subset of the rationals to ${int(I(x)): x in S without S'}$. Hence, the
    number of elements in $S without S'$ must be countable at most.

    Here, the argument does not change if we factor the left endpoints of
    intervals, since union of finitely many countable sets remains countable.

#solution[
  Consider the function
  $ g(x) = sum_(q_n in QQ) 1 / (4^n abs(x-q)), $
  where $q_1, q_2, ...$ is some enumeration of the rationals.
  This function can take the value $infinity$, so denote $X$ as the set of all
  $x in RR$ with $f(x) = infinity$. By @prob-borel-fn, we have $|{x
  in RR: f(x) >= 1}| <= 2$. However, this result can be generalize by taking
  $ A(beta) = union.big_(q_n in QQ) [q - beta^n, q + beta^n], $
  for some $beta in (0, 1)$. Then for every $x in.not A(beta)$,
  $ g(x) <= sum_(n = 1)^infinity 1 / ((4 beta)^n) = 1 / (4beta - 1) < infinity. $

  Measuring the set $RR without A(beta)$ yields $lambda(RR without
  A(alpha, beta)) <= 2 sum_(n = 1)^infinity beta^n = beta / (beta - 1)$.
  Clearly, $X$ must be a subset of all $A(beta)$, so its measure must be smaller
  than $beta / (beta - 1)$ for all $beta > 0$. Hence, $|X| = 0$.

  Now, if we let $f = g chi_(RR without X)$, then $f = g$ at most points.
  Hence, the integral of $f$ on some interval $I$ takes the same value as that
  of $g$, which is
  $
    integral chi_I f dif lambda = integral chi_I g dif lambda = sum_(q_n
    in QQ) integral (chi_I (x)) / (4^n abs(x - q_n)) dif lambda.

  If $q_n in I_n$, the integral $integral (chi_I (x)) / (4^n abs(x - q_n))
  dif lambda$ diverges.

  We are sure that there exists no $x$ such that $f^+ (x) = f^- (x) = infinity$,

  Effectively, after this, we reduces the problem to the case where $f_k$ is
  non-negative and monotonic. If $f_k$ is increasing then this is the Monotone
  Convergence Theorem, and when $f_k$ is decreasing, we can define $g_k = f_1 -
  f_k$, then $g_k$ is non-negative and increasing, hence:

  Consider $f(x) = sin(x)/x$ (at $x=0$ we let $f(x)=1$). Then,
  $
    integral_0^t (sin x) / x dif x &= "const" - integral_1^t (dif (cos x)) / x\
    &= "const" - ((cos x) / x)|_1^t - integral_1^t (cos x) / x^2 dif x.
  $
  As $t -> infinity$, we can see that the final expression is bounded (the
  integral is dominated by $integral_1^infinity 1/x^2 dif x = 1$).

  But,
  $
    integral_0^(2pi N) abs((sin x) / x) dif x &= sum_(n = 0)^(N - 1) integral_(2 pi n)^(2 pi

  Let $c$ be a real number and $g = |h| - c$.

  If $b in RR$ such that $h^* (b) > c$, there exists some $t > 0$ such
  that
  $ I = integral_(b-t)^(b+t) (|h|-c) = integral_(b-t)^(b+t) g > 0. $

  By Theorem 3.28 (MIRA), for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists some
  $delta(epsilon) > 0$
  such that for every Lebesgue measurable subset $A subset.eq (b-t, b+t)$ with
  Lebesgue measure at most $2delta(epsilon)$, $abs(integral_(A) g dif lambda) < epsilon$.

  From this, if we have $A, B subset.eq (b-t,b+t)$ such that their symmetric

  $ abs(integral_A g dif lambda - integral_B g dif lambda) <= abs(integral_(A

  If we let $A = (b-t, b+t)$ and $epsilon = I/2$, then
  $ I - integral_B g dif lambda < I, $

  radius $r' < t$ such that $(b'-r', b'+r') subset.eq A = (b-t, b+t)$, while making

  $E$ as the union of all such $I_n$'s.
  Then, we can calculate $ d(t) = |E sect (-t, t)|$. Similarly to the previous
  example, we will only concern ourselves with the values of $d(t)$ when $t =
  1/(n+1)$ and $t=1/(n+1) +s/(n(n+1))$. The other values of $t$ are squeezed
  between them, and it is provable (albeit somewhat tedious) that only the two
  cases mentioned matter here.

  - $m(1/(n+1)) = sum_(k = n + 1)^infinity s/(k(k+1)) = s/(n+1)$.
  - $m(1 / (n+1) + s / (n(n+1))) = sum_(k = n)^infinity s / (k(k+1)) = s / n$.

  Either way, the limit $(m(t))/t$ both approaches $s$ as $n -> infinity$, so by
  letting $s = 1/3$, we have our desired example.

#solution[
  Assuming $E$ is non-empty. For every $b in.not E$, we have:
  $
    0 = lim_(t->0^+) abs(E sect (x-t, x+t)) / (2t) = lim_(t->0^+) 1 / (2t)
    integral_(b-t)^(b+t) chi_E,
  $
  and from the inequality used in the proof of 4.19 (MIRA),
  the derivative of $G(x) = integral_a^x chi_(RR without E)$ at $b$ must be 0.
  Here $a$ is an arbitrary constant.

  Similarly, the derivative of $F(x) = integral_a^x chi_(E)$ at any $b in E$ must
  be 1, and since $F(x) + G(x) = x - a$ for all $x in RR$, we
  have $F'(x) = chi_E$ everywhere.

  For a given $b > a$, the Mean Value Theorem states that there exists some $c
in (a, b)$ such that:
  $ chi_E (c) = F'(c) = (F(b)-F(a)) / (b-a) = (|E sect (a, b)|) / (b-a). $

  From this, either $abs(E sect (a, b)) = b - a$ or $0$ for every $b > a$.
  If $abs(E sect (a, b)) = 1$, then the density of every point in $(a, b)$ must
  be 1, which means $(a, b) subset.eq E$. Similarly, if $abs(E sect (a, b)) =
  0$, then $(a, b) subset.eq RR without E$.

  This is a bizarre set of conditions, which could only hold in the most trivial
  cases: $E = diameter$ or $E = RR$. Assuming otherwise, then there must be some
  $u in E$ and $v in.not E$, and letting $a = u - epsilon$ and $b = v + epsilon$
  clearly yield a contradiction: $(a, b)$ can't be in $E$ (it contains $v$) or
  in $RR without E$ (it contains $u$).

  Let $Tc$ be the set of all subsets $E subset.eq X times X$ such that ${x in
  X: (x, x) in E} in Sc$.

  Then, $Tc$ contains all $A times B$ where $A in Sc$ and $B in Sc$:
  $ {x in X: (x, x) in A times B} = A sect B in Sc. $

  Finally, to finish the proof, we need to prove that $Tc$ is a
  $sigma$-algebra, i.e. it is closed under complementation and countable union:
  - *Complementation*: If $E in Tc$ then ${x in X: (x, x) in (X times X)
    without E} = X without {x in X: (x, x) in E} in Sc$, so $X times X) without
    E in Tc$.
  - *Countable union*: If $E_k in Tc$ for $k = 1, 2, ...$ then $ {x in X: (x, x)
    in union.big_(k=1)^infinity E_k} = union.big_(k=1)^infinity {x in X: (x, x)
    in E_k} in Sc$, so $union.big_(k=1)^infinity E_k in Tc$.

  Let $V$ be some non-Borel measurable set. Then, define $E = {(x, x): x in V}$.
  The cross-sections of $E$ at any given point is either a singleton or the
  empty set, which are both clearly measurable.

  However, $E in.not cal(B) times cal(B)$. Assuming otherwise, since $f: x |->
  (x, x)$ is a Borel measurable function from $RR$ to $RR times RR$, its
  preimage of $E$ must also be measurable. However, the preimage itself is $V$,
  which is a non-Borel measurable set, a contradiction.

#solution[
  Define $hat(f)(x, y) = f(x)$. Then, $hat(f)^(-1) (E) = f^(-1) (E) times Y$,
  which is $(Sc ox Tc)$-measurable as long as $f^(-1) (E)$ is $Sc$-measurable.
  Hence, $hat(f)$ is $(Sc ox Tc)$-measurable. Similarly, define $hat(g)(x, y) = g(y)$,
  which is also $(Sc ox Tc)$-measurable. Since $h$ is simply the product of
  $hat(f)$ and $hat(g)$, it follows that $h$ is $(Sc ox Tc)$-measurable as well.

#solution[
  Assuming $E = union.big_(n = 1)^N I_n$, where $I_n$ are intervals.

  Then, $RR without E = sect.big_(n=1)^N (RR without I_n)$.
  Since every $RR without I_n$ can be written as the union of at most two
  interval $I_n^0$ and $I_n^1$, we have:
  $
    RR without E = sect.big_(n=1)^N (I_n^0 union I_n^1) = union.big_(b in {0, 1}^N)
    sect.big_(n=1)^N I_n^(b_n).

  This is a finite union of intervals of $RR$, so clearly it belongs to the
  algebra.

#solution[
  This trivially holds: under the assumption of closeness under complementation,
  closed under finite intersections and closed under finite unions is the same
  thing. The only slightly non-trivial thing is proving $cal(A)$ contains the
  empty set if it's closed under finite intersection and complementation: take
  any $A in cal(A)$, then $A sect (W without A) = diameter in cal(A)$, QED.

  2 and 3 are trivially equivalent. 2 (or 3) implies 1 by definition.

  1 implies 3 since if $X = union.big_(k=1)^infinity X_k$, where each $mu(X_k) <
    infinity$, then
  $ X'_k = X_k without union.big_(k' < k) X_(k'), mu(X'_k) <= mu(X_k) < infinity $

  Prove that if $omega$ is a measure on $Sc ox Tc$ such that $omega(A times B) =
  mu(A) nu(B)$ for all $A in Sc$ and $B in Tc$, then $omega = mu times nu$.

#solution[
  Let $W$ be the set of all $E in Sc ox Tc$ such that $omega(E) = (mu times
nu)(E) = integral_X integral_Y chi_E (x, y) dif nu(y) dif mu (x).$

  Then, $W$ contains all finite unions of measurable rectangles, so we will show
  that it is a monotone class:

  If $E_1 subset.eq E_2 subset.eq ...$ such that $E_n in W$, then
  $
    omega(union.big_(n = 1)^infinity E_n) = lim_(n -> infinity) omega(E_n) =
    lim_(n -> infinity) (mu times nu)(E_n) = (mu times nu)(union.big_(n =
      1)^infinity E_n).
  $

  Similarly, if $E_1 supset.eq E_2 supset.eq ...$ such that $E_n in W$, then
  $
    omega(sect.big_(n = 1)^infinity E_n) = (mu times nu)(sect.big_(n =
      1)^infinity E_n).
  $

  Hence, $W$ is a monotone class that contains the algebra of measurable
  rectangles, so it must contain the smallest $sigma$-algebra generated by these
  rectangles, $Sc ox Tc$.
