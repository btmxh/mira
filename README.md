My (and others') solutions to Sheldon Axler's _Measure, Integration & Real Analysis_.

Go and check out the book [here](https://measure.axler.net/), it's peak. #625
recommended it 100%.

Tedious problems (that provides not really much insights) were skipped, sorry.

Many solutions here are mostly taken from Math Stackexchange, but I forgot where
they were from, sorry. I will try to credit people more, I guess. Hence, this is
released under public domain.

A lot of hidden assumptions were omitted in the proofs, so some proof might feel
unrigorous at times, not to mention my carelessness too.
