#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function such that
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) = U(f, P, [a, b]) $
  for some partition $P$ of $[a, b]$. Prove that $f$ is constant on $[a, b]$.
]

#solution[
  Suppose $P$ is the partition $a = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = b$, then
  $
    0 = U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) = sum_(j = 1)^n (x_j - x_(j-1))
    (sup_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f - inf_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f)
  $

  Then, it becomes trivial that we must have
  $ sup_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f - inf_([x_(j - 1), x_j]) f = 0, forall j = 1, ..., n $

  This is equivalent to the fact that $f$ is constant on $[x_(j-1), x_j]$, for
  all $j = 1, ..., n$. Hence $f$ is constant on $[a, b]$.

#problem[
  Suppose $a <= s < t <= b$. Define $f: [a, b] -> RR$ by
  $ f(x) = cases(1 "if" s < x < t, 0 "otherwise") $. Prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable on $[a, b]$, and that $integral_a^b f = t - s$.
]

#solution[
  Let $P_epsilon$ be the partition $a, s + epsilon, t - epsilon, b$ for some
  sufficiently small $epsilon > 0$ such that $a < s + epsilon < t - epsilon < b$.

  It is trivial to see that:
  $
          L(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) & = t - s - 2epsilon, \
    "and" U(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) & = t - s + 2epsilon
  $

  Now, consider an arbitrary partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have:
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) = t - s + 2epsilon $

  Letting $epsilon$ go to zero and taking the supremum of the left hand side, we
  have:
  $ sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]) <= t - s $

  But, $L(f, P_epsilon, [a, b]) = t - s - 2epsilon$, which converges to $t - s$
  as $epsilon$ goes to zero. Hence, equality must hold: $sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]) = t - s$.

  Similarly, it is true that $inf_P U(f, P, [a, b]) = t - s$. Hence, $L(f, [a,
      b]) = U(f, [a, b]) = t - s$, QED.

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function. Prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable if and only if for each $epsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$
  of $[a, b]$ such that
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $
]

#solution[
  If $f$ is Riemann integrable, then denote $I = integral_a^b f$. Then,
  $ I = inf_P U(f, P, [a, b]) - sup_P L(f, P, [a, b]), $
  which means for every $epsilon' > 0$, there exists partitions $P_1, P_2$ such
  that
  $ U(f, P_1, [a, b]) <= I + epsilon' "and" L(f, P_2, [a, b]) >= I - epsilon'. $

  Let $P$ be the combination of the two partitions, then:
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) <= I + epsilon' "and" L(f, P, [a, b]) >= I - epsilon. $

  Hence, $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) <= 2epsilon'$, so by taking $epsilon' =
  1 / 2 epsilon$, we have $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon$.

  Now, assuming the opposite, suppose for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists a
  partition $P$ such that $U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon$. From
  this, we must have $U(f, [a, b]) - L(f, [a, b]) < epsilon$ for every $epsilon
  > 0$. This can only hold if the left hand side expression is 0, which means
  that $f$ is Riemann integrable.

#problem[
  Suppose $f, g: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that $f + g$ is also
  Riemann integrable and
  $ integral_a^b (f + g) = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b g $
]

#solution[
  Let $P$ be a partition of $[a, b]$, then
  $
    L(f + g, P, [a, b]) >= L(f, P, [a, b]) + L(g, P, [a, b]) >= L(f, [a, b]) +
    L(g, [a, b]), \
    "and" U(f + g, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) + U(g, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, [a,
        b]) + U(g, [a, b])
  $

  Taking the infimum/supremum of the left hand sides yields
  $
    L(f + g, [a, b]) >= L(f, [a, b]) + L(g, [a, b]) = U(f, [a, b]) + U(g, [a,
        b]) >= U(f + g, [a, b])
  $
  The middle equality holds since $f$ and $g$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.
  Now, we have $L(f+g, [a, b]) >= U(f+g, [a, b])$, which must be an equality,
  so $f+g$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and
  $ integral_a^b (f + g) = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b g $
  holds.

#problem[
  Suppose $f, g: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that $f - g$ is also
  Riemann integrable and
  $ integral_a^b (f - g) = integral_a^b f - integral_a^b g $
]

#solution[
  For every partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have:
  $ L(f, P, [a, b]) = -U(-f, P, [a, b]) "and" U(f, P, [a, b]) = -L(-f, P, [a, b]) $
  From this, it should be trivial to solve this problem.

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Suppose $g: [a, b] -> RR$ is
  a function such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all except finitely many $x in [a, b]$.
  Prove that $g$ is also Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and
  $ integral_a^b g = integral_a^b f $
]

#solution[
  We will concern ourselves with the easy case where $f(x) = 0$ for all $x in
  [a, b]$. Then, if $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n$ are the only values of $x$ such that
  $g(x_i) != 0, forall i = 1, ..., n$, then the partition $P_epsilon$ with $a < x_1 -
  epsilon < x_1 + epsilon < x_2 - epsilon < x_2 + epsilon < ... < x_n - epsilon
  < x_n + epsilon < b$ will yields the following result
  $
          U(f, P, [a, b]) & = 2epsilon sum_(i = 1)^n max{0, g(x_i)}, \
    "and" L(f, P, [a, b]) & = 2epsilon sum_(i = 1)^n min{0, g(x_i)}.
  $
  Letting $epsilon -> 0$ shows that $U(f, [a, b]) <= 0 <= L(f, [a, b])$, so we
  must have $ integral_a^b g = 0 $.

  Back to the general case, since the function $g - f$ satisfies the conditions
  of $g$ as above, $g - f$ must be Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$, and that
  $integral_a^b (g - f) = 0$. Hence, $g$, the sum of two Riemann integrable
  functions $f$ and $g-f$, must also be Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$, and
  $ integral_a^b g = integral_a^b f + integral_a^b (g - f) = integral_a^b f $

#problem[
  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is a bounded function. For $n in ZZ^+$, let $P_n$
  denote the partition that divides $[a, b]$ into $2^n$ intervals of equal size.
  Prove that
  $
    L(f, [a, b]) = lim_(n -> infinity) L(f, P_n, [a, b]) "and" U(f, [a, b]) =
    lim_(n -> infinity) U(f, P_n, [a, b]).
  $
]

#solution[
  The sequence $l_n = L(f, P_n, [a, b])$ is non-decreasing, so $lim_(n -> infinity)
  L(f, P_n, [a, b])$ definitely exists. Denote this limit as $L$, so $L$ must
  be at least as large as $L(f, [a, b])$. Our aim is to prove that equality
  actually holds here.

  For every partition $Q$ of $[a, b]$, denote $Q_n$ as the combination of $P_n$
  and $Q$. Then,
  $ L(f, [a, b]) = L(f, Q, [a, b]) <= L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) $

  We will establish an upper bound for $L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b])$.
  Note that these two only differs at most $m$ elements (where $m$ is the
  number of partition points (excluding $a$ and $b$) of $Q$), so this difference
  is basically $O(m w delta)$, where $w$ is the maximum width of a partitioned
  interval (which is $(b-a) / 2^n)$, $delta$ is the maximum difference between two
  values of $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ for some $x, y in [a, b]$.

  $m$ is bounded (since $Q$ stays constant), $delta$ is also bounded by
  $sup_[a, b] f - inf_[a, b] f$ (which is finite since $f$ is bounded) while
  $w -> 0$. Hence, this big-O term converges to $0$ as $n -> infinity$. This
  big-O thingy is not really rigorous, but it should be trivial to make it
  rigorous from here. Anyways, since $L(f, Q_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b]) ->
  0$, so does $L(f, P_n, [a, b]) - L(f, [a, b])$. Hence,

  $ lim_(n -> infinity) L(f, P_n, [a, b]) = L(f, [a, b]). $

  Needless to say, the other conclusion can be proven similarly.

      (j(b-a)) / n).

#solution[
  This follows the same logic as the previous exercise. Note that since $f$ is
  Riemann integrable, it must also be bounded by definition.

  Suppose $f: [a, b] -> RR$ is Riemann integrable. Prove that if $c, d in RR$
  and $a <= c < d <= b$, then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[c, d]$.
]

#solution[
  For every $epsilon > 0$, there exists a partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ such that
  $ U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $

  Adding the points $c$ and $d$ to $P$ yields a new partition $P'$ of $[a, b]$,
  which must satisfy
  $ U(f, P', [a, b]) - L(f, P', [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) < epsilon $

  From the definition of lower and upper Riemann sums, we must have the
  following
  $
    U(f, P'', [c, d]) - L(f, P'', [c, d]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]) <
    epsilon,
  $
  where $P''$ is $P'$ restricted to the interval $[c, d]$, QED.

  $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ if and only if $f$ is Riemann integrable

  if these conditions hold, then:
  $
    integral_a^b f = integral_a^c f + integral_c^b f.
  $
]

#solution[
  Using the previous exercise, it should be trivial to prove that $f$ is Riemann
  integrable on $[a, c]$ and $[c, b]$ if $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.

  Now, if $f$ is Riemann integrable on the two intervals, for any $epsilon > 0$,
  there exists partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ such that:

  $
    I_1 - epsilon < L(f, P_1, [a, c]) <= U(f, P_1, [a, c]) < I_1 + epsilon, \
    "and" I_2 - epsilon < L(f, P_2, [c, b]) <= U(f, P_2, [c, b]) < I_2 + epsilon,
  $
  where $I_1 = integral_a^c f$ and $I_2 = integral_c^b f$.

  Then, the combined partition $P$ of $P_1$ and $P_2$ on $[a, b]$ must satisfy
  $ I_1 + I_2 - 2epsilon < L(f, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) < I_1 + I_2 + 2epsilon $

  From this it is trivial to conclude the exercise.

  - $f$ is left-continuous at $t = a$: This is equivalent to proving
    $ lim_(t -> a^+) integral_a^t f(t) = 0 $

    $integral_a^t f(t) = U(f, [a, t]) <= U(f, P, [a, t]) = (t - a) sup_[a, t]
    f <= (t - a) sup_[a, b] f -> 0$ as $t -> a^+$.

#solution[
  For any interval $I$, we have
  $ 0 <= sup_I |f| - inf_I |f| <= sup_I f - inf_I f, $
  therefore, for every partitions $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have
  $ U(|f|, P, [a, b]) - L(|f|, P, [a, b]) <= U(f, P, [a, b]) - L(f, P, [a, b]). $
  Using the epsilon thing, we can see that $|f|$ is Riemann integrable.

  To prove the inequality, it suffices to note that $|f| plus.minus f$ is always
  non-negative, and therefore have non-negative Riemann integrals.
  Hence, $ integral_a^b |f| >= max{integral_a^b (|f| - f) + integral_a^b f,
    integral_a^b (f + |f|) - integral_a^b f} >= abs(integral_a^b f) $.

  Consider the uniform partition $P_n$ of $[a, b]$ into $N = 2^n$ subintervals, then

    "and" U(f, P_n, [a, b]) = 1 / N sum_(j = 1)^N f(a + j(b-a) / N).
  $

  Hence,
  $ U(f, P_n, [a, b]) - L(f, P_n, [a, b]) = (f(b) - f(a)) / N -> 0, $
  as $n -> infinity$, therefore $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$.

    integral_a^b f = lim_(n -> infinity) integral_a^b f_n.

#solution[
  $f_n$ converging to $f$ uniformly means
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) sup_[a, b] |f - f_n| = 0 $

  Let $u_n = sup_[a, b] |f-f_n|$, then for any interval $[c, d] subset.eq [a,
    b]$, if $x_0$ is the value of $x in [c, d]$ such that $f (x_0) = sup_[c, d] f$,
  we must have:
  $
    abs(sup_[c, d] f - sup_[c, d] f_n) <= abs(f(x_0) - f_n (x_0)) + abs(

#solution[
  It is trivial to see $L(f, [0, 1]) = 0$. Now it suffices to prove that $U(f,
    [0, 1]) = 0$.

  Consider the uniform partition $P$ that divides $[0, 1]$ into $n(n-1) + 2$
  equal subintervals. Then, since every rational number lies in at most 2
  subintervals, we must have the following:
  $
    U(f, P, [0, 1]) <= 2 / (n(n-1) + 2) sum_(k = 1)^(n(n-1) / 2+1) f(q_k),
  $
  where $q_1, q_2, ...$ is an enumeration of the rationals in $[0, 1]$,
  ordered by $f(q_1) < f(q_2) < ...$. In fact, by noting that $q_1 = 1, q_2 =
  1 / 2, q_3 = 1 / 3, q_4 = 2 / 3, ...$ (here, if $f(p) = f(q)$ then we fallback to
  default ordering to enumerate $p$ and $q$), it is possible to evaluate the sum as
  $ sum_(k = 1)^(n(n-1) / 2+1) f(q_k) = 1 + sum_(k = 2)^n (k - 1) / k <= n $

    forall n > N
  $

  We will iteratively construct $x_n$ and $r_n$ as follows.

  1. Divides $[0, 1]$ into two equal subintervals $(0, 1 / 2)$ and $(1 / 2, 1)$.
    Then, let $(x_1 - r_1, x_1 + r_1) = (0, 1 / 2)$, i.e. $x_1 = 1 / 4$ and $r_1 = 1 / 4$.
  2. For every $x in [0, 1 / 2]$, we will let $N = 1$, which means that $(x_n
      - r_n, x_n + r_n) subset.eq (1 / 2, 1)$ for all $n > 1$. The idea is very
    simple: we just chop that interval into two subintervals again: $(x_2-r_2,
      x_2+r_2) = [1 / 2, 3 / 4]$, and $(x_n-r_n, x_n+r_n) subset.eq [3 / 4, 1]$ for
    all $n > 2$. Then, $x_2 = 5 / 8$ and $r_2 = 1 / 8$.
  3. Continue the steps above to infinity.

  More rigorously, we can define $x_n$ and $r_n$ explicitly as follows:
  $ r_n = 1 / 2^(n + 1) "and" x_n = 1 - 3 / 2^(n + 1). $

  Then, for every $x in [0, 1)$ ($x = 1$ does not lie on any $[x_n - r_n,
    x_n + r_n]$, so we can ignore this case), there exists some $N$ such that
  $ 1 / 2^N <= 1 - x < 1 / 2^(N - 1). $
  So if,
  $
    & x in (x_n - r_n, x_n + r_n) = (1 - 1 / 2^(n - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^n) \
    & => (1 - 1 / 2^(N - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^N] sect (1 - 1 / 2^(n - 1), 1 - 1 / 2^n) !=
      emptyset                                                       \
    & => N = n
  $

  Hence, for every $n > N$, $x$ can not belong to $(x_n - r_n, x_n + r_n)$,
  which is equivalent to $f_n (x) = 0, forall n > N$. Hence, $f(x) = 0$ for all
  $x in [0, 1]$, and therefore
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) integral_0^1 f_n = 1 != 0 = integral_0^1 f. $

#problem[
  Suppose $F$ is a subset of $RR$ with the property that every open cover of $F$
  has a finite subcover. Prove that $F$ is closed and bounded.
]

#solution[
  Consider the following open cover of $RR$ (and therefore $F$):
  $ F subset.eq RR = union.big_(n in ZZ^+) (-n, n). $
  Since $F$ has a finite subcover, denoted $(-n_1, n_1), (-n_2, n_2), ...,
  (-n_k, n_k)$, it must be contained in $(-max_(i = 1, ..., k) n_i, max_(i = 1,
    ..., k) n_i)$. Hence, $F$ is bounded.

  Denote $d(x, y) = |x - y|$ as the distance between two real numbers $x$ and
  $y$#footnote[This is to make it so that this argument generalizes well to
    higher-dimensional spaces (and Hausdorff topological spaces in general)],
  $B(x, r) = (x-r, x+r)$ as the open ball centered at $x$ with radius $r$.

  Consider an arbitrary $x_0 in RR without F$, then
  $ cal(C) = {B(x, 1 / 2 d(x, x_0)) | x in C} $
  is an open cover of $F$. Hence, there exists finitely many $x_1, x_2, ...,
  x_n$ such that $ F subset.eq union.big_(k = 1)^n B(x_k, 1 / 2 d(x_k, x_0)). $

  Now, consider $ N = B(x_0, 1 / 2 min_(k = 1, 2, ...n) d(x_k, x_0)), $
  $N$ clearly does not intersect any of $B(x_k, 1 / 2 d(x_k, x_0))$, so $N$ does
  not contain any element in $F$, i.e. $N subset.eq RR without F$.

  Hence, $RR without F$ is open, i.e. $F$ is closed.

  Let $A'$ be the set of closed and bounded sets in $A$ and pick any $B in A'$.

  $
    B subset.eq RR without sect.big_(F in A without {B}) F = union.big_(F in A

  Here, we have an open cover of closed and bounded $B$, so there must exists
  finitely many $F_1, F_2, ..., F_n$ such that

  $ B subset.eq union.big_(k = 1)^n (RR without F_k). $

#solution[
  If $(a, b) sect (c, d) = diameter$, then WLOG assuming $a < b < c < d$, and

  $ b - a + d - c >= |(a, b) union (c, d)| >= d - a - c + b. $
  This means $|(a, b) union (c, d)| = b - a + d - c$.

  Now, if $|(a, b) union (c, d)| = b - a + d - c = |(a, b)| + |(c, d)|$, then we
  must have $|(a, b) sect (c, d)| = 0$. The intersection of two open interval
  is either empty, or another open interval (with non-zero outer measure).

  For every open interval $I = (c, d)$,
  - $(c, d) sect (-t, t)$ is an open interval $(max{c, -t}, min{d, t})$. Denote
    this interval as $alpha(I)$.
  - For every $epsilon > 0$,
    $
      (c, d) sect (RR without (-t, t)) & = ((c, d) sect (-infinity, -t]) union ((c,
                                             d) sect [t, infinity))                                    \

    $
    Denote $beta(I) = (c, min{d, -t})$ and $gamma(I) = (max{c, t}, d)$.

  It is trivial to see that $ell(I) = ell(alpha(I)) + ell(beta(I)) +
  ell(gamma(I))$, and if $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval cover of $A$, the
  following are covers of $A sect (-t, t)$ and $A sect (RR without (-t, t))$
  respectively:
  - $S = {alpha(I_1), alpha(I_2), ...}$ of $A sect (-t, t)$.
  - $T = {(t-epsilon, t+epsilon), (-t-epsilon, -t+epsilon), beta(I_1), beta(I_2),
      ..., gamma(I_1), gamma(I_2), ...}$ of $A sect (RR without (-t, t))$.

  We have:
  $
    sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) & = (sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(alpha(I_n))) +
                                  (sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(beta(I_n, epsilon)) + sum_(n=1)^infinity
                                    ell(gamma(I_n, epsilon)))                                     \

                                & >= |A sect (-t, t)| + |A sect (RR without (-t, t))| - 4epsilon.
  $

  Letting $epsilon -> 0$ and taking the infimum of left hand side, it must be
  the case that $|A| >= |A sect (-t, t)| + |A sect (RR without (-t, t))|$.
  Combining this with subadditivity yields the desired result.

#problem[
  Prove that $|A| = lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect (-t, t)|$ for all $A subset.eq
  RR$.
] <outer-measure-limit>

#solution[
  We consider the following two cases:

  - If $|A| < +infinity$, then the equality is equivalent to $lim_(t ->
    infinity) |A without (-t, t)| = 0$. This limit definitely exists and is
    non-negative due to the fact that $f(t) = |A without (-t, t)|$ is decreasing
    and non-negative.

    Assuming that this limit is positive, i.e. there exists some $epsilon, t_0 > 0$
    such that $forall t > t_0, |A without (-t, t)| > epsilon$. This is equivalent to
    the fact that if $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval cover of $A without (-t,
      t)$, then $sum_(k = 1)^infinity ell(I_k) > epsilon$.

    Furthermore, if this series converges to some $S < +infinity$, then there
    exists some $k_0$ such that $sum_(k=1)^k_0 ell(I_k) > L - epsilon$ and
    therefore $sum_(k=k_0+1)^infinity ell(I_k) < epsilon$. If we take

    $ t' = max{t, max_(1 <= k <= k_0) (max {-inf I_k, sup I_k})}, $

    then $I_(k_0+1), I_(k_0+2), ...$ is an open interval cover of $A without (-t',
      t')$, but $sum_(k=k_0+1)^infinity ell(I_k) < epsilon$, a contradiction. Hence,
    it must be the case that $sum_(k=1)^infinity ell(I_k) = +infinity$.

    However, this means that $|A|$ must be equal to $+infinity$, a
    contradiction.

  - If $|A| = +infinity$, then we have to prove $lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect
    (-t, t)| = +infinity$. This limit exists due to monotonicity, so we assume
    the limit is finite, i.e. there exists some $M > 0$ such that $M > |A sect
    (-t, t)|$ for all $t in RR$.

    #lemma[
      If $I_1, I_2, ...$ is an open interval partition of $RR without C$, where
      $C$ is a countable set, then for all $A subset.eq RR$, $ |A| = sum_(k =
      1)^infinity |A sect I_k|. $
    ] <outer-measure-lemma>

    #proof[
      We trivially have $|A| <= sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A sect I_k|$ due to
      subadditivity. Consider an arbitrary open interval cover $J_1, J_2, ...$
      of $A$, then for every $k in NN$, $J_1 sect I_k, J_2 sect I_k, ...$ is an
      interval of $A sect I_k$, so it must be the case that

      $ |A sect I_k| <= sum_(j = 1)^infinity ell(J_j sect I_k). $

      Hence,

      $
        sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A sect I_k| <= sum_(k = 1)^infinity sum_(j =
        1)^infinity ell(J_j sect I_k) = sum_(j = 1)^infinity ell(J_j),
      $

      where the last equality holds due to the fact that $I_1, I_2, ...$ is a
      partition of $RR without C$.

      However, by the definition of the outer measure, $sum_(j = 1)^infinity
      ell(J_j) <= |A|$, so equality must hold: $|A| = sum_(k = 1)^infinity |A
      sect I_k|$.
    ]

    Now, consider the following open interval partition of $RR without ZZ$:
    $ (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 2), (-2, -1), ..., $
    i.e. $I_k = (pi(k), pi(k) + 1)$, where $pi$ denotes some bijection from
    $NN$ to $ZZ$.

    Then, we have $|A sect (-t, t)| = sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t,
      t)|$. Hence, $ lim_(t -> infinity) |A sect (-t, t)| = lim_(t -> infinity)
    sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t, t)| < M. $

    However, for every $t in ZZ$, we have:

    $
      sum_(k in ZZ) |A sect (k, k + 1) sect (-t, t)| = sum_(k = -t)^(t - 1) |A
      sect (k, k + 1)|.
    $

    So,

    $ sum_(k = -infinity)^infinity |A sect (k, k + 1)| < M. $

    Applying the lemma again, we have $|A| = sum_(k = -infinity)^infinity |A
    sect (k, k + 1)|$. Hence, $|A| < M$, a contradiction with $|A| = +infinity$.

  We will construct this set step-by-step.

  The set of reals with decimal expansion having the digit $5$ appearing right
  after the decimal place is,

  $ S(1) = union.big_(k in ZZ) [k + 0.5, k + 0.6]. $

  Here, for simplicity, we consider $0.6 = 0.59999...$ to be a part of $S(1)$.

  Then, this result can be trivially generalized: the set of reals with decimal
  expansion having the digit $5$ appearing at the $k$-th position after the
  decimal place is $S(k) = 10^(-k) S(1)$.

  Now, if $r$ is a real number with finitely many 5's in its decimal expansion,
  then there exists some natural number $N$ such that $r in.not S(k)$ for all $k
  > N$. Hence, the set of all such $r$ must be,

  $ T = union.big_(N in NN) (RR without union.big_(k > N) S(k)). $

  The complement of $T$ is the set we need to construct: the set of real numbers
  that have a decimal expansion with the digit 5 appearing infinitely often.

  Now, looking back at our construction, we can see that we only use the
  complement and (countably infinite) union operation, so the complement of $T$
  in $RR$ is a Borel set.

  #lemma[
    A uncountable subset $S$ of $RR$ can always be partitioned into two
    uncountable subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $sup A <= inf B$.
  ]

  #proof[
    Define $M = {x in R : S sect (-infinity, x) "is countable" }$ and $N =
    {x in R : S sect (x, infinity) "is countable" }$.

    If $M sect N$ has some element $u$, then $S subset.eq (S sect (-infinity, u)) union
    (S sect (u, infinity)) union {u}$ must be countable, a contradiction.
    However, it can be proven that $m = sup M in M$ by writing

    $
      S sect (-infinity, m) = union.big_(k = 1)^infinity (S sect (-infinity, m -
          1 / k)),
    $
    where we can be sure that $m - epsilon in S$ for all $epsilon > 0$.

    The right-hand-side expression is the countable union of countable sets, so
    $S sect (-infinity, m)$ must be countable as well. Similarly, we can prove
    that $n = inf N in N$.

    Now, if $m < n$, then we can pick $r = (m + n) / 2 in RR without M without N$,
    and define $A = S sect (-infinity, r)$, $B = S sect [r, infinity)$.

    Otherwise, if $m >= n$, then $M sect N$ is nonempty, a contradiction.
  ]

  Using the lemma, we can see that if $f(X)$ is uncountable, we can partition it
  into two uncountable subsets $A$ and $B$. Then, $f^(-1)(A)$ and $f^(-1)(B)$
  are both uncountable, so $f$ is not measurable, a contradiction.

  Hence, $f(X)$ must be countable, i.e. there exists a partition $X_1, X_2, ...$ of $X$ such that $f(X_i) = {y_i}$ are singletons and $y_i != y_j$ for all $i
  != j$.

  Since $f^(-1)({y_i}) = X_i$, all $X_i$ must be countable or have a countable
  complement (cocountable). If there are two cocountable sets $X_1$ and $X_2$
  (without loss of generality, and we assume $y_1 < y_2$ here),
  then $f^(-1)((-infinity, (y_1+y_2) / 2)) supset.eq X_1$ and
  $f^(-1)(((y_1+y_2) / 2, infinity)) supset.eq X_2$, which are both uncountable,
  so none of the preimages can be in the $Sc$. Hence,

  $ f "is non-constant on a countable set." $

  We can trivially verify that all $f$ satisfying the above property is
  $Sc$-measurable.

  Define a mapping $mu$ as follows:

  Since $f$ is increasing, for every $x_0 in B$, there exists left and right
  limits:
  $
    f^+(x) = lim_(x -> x_0^+) f(x) = inf f((x, +infinity)), f^-(x) = lim_(x ->
    x_0^-) f(x) = sup f((-infinity, x)).
  $

  $f$ is discontinuous at $x$ if and only if $f^+(x) > f^-(x)$. Then, there
  exists rationals $q$ in $(f^-(x), f^+(x))$. For each such $q$, we define
  $mu(q) = x$.

  For every unmarked $q$, we let $mu(q)$ be some undefined value, e.g.
  $diameter$. We can be sure that a rational $q$ is never marked twice, since
  the intervals $(f^-(x), f^+(x))$ does not intersect. Then, $mu$ is an
  surjective#footnote[This statement might not be true if there is no $q$ that
    maps to $diameter$ but this is just a small and easily fixable detail.]

  discontinuities of $f$.

]

#solution[
  Let $Sc = {B subset.eq RR: f(B) "is a Borel set"}$. Proving $Sc$ is a
  $sigma$-algebra containing all open sets reduces to proving the following:

  #lemma[If $E subset.eq RR$ is open, than $f(E)$ is a Borel set.]

  #proof[
    $E$ can be written as the disjoint union of countably many open intervals
    $I_k$, so this effectively reduces the problem to the case where $E = (a,
      b)$ for some $a, b in RR$.

    Denote $Y = RR without f((a, b))$. Define an equivalent relation $tilde$ as
    $x tilde y <==> [x, y] subset.eq Y$. Then, the equivalent classes $C_alpha$,
    $alpha in A$ must be disjoint intervals. If some interval $C_alpha = {y}$ is
    degenerate (a singleton), then there are sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ such
    that:
    - $f(a_n)$ is strictly increasing and have a upper bound of $y$.
    - $f(b_n)$ is strictly decreasing and have a upper bound of $y$.

    Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $a_n$ and $b_n$ are monotonic sequences
    ($a_n$ strictly increasing, $b_n$ strictly decreasing), and therefore they
    both converges at some $u = lim a_n$ and $v = lim b_n$. Then, $f(u) >= y >=
    f(v)$, so it must be the case that $u = v$ and $f(u) = y$, which contradicts
    $y in RR without f((a, b))$.

    Hence, $Y$ can be partitioned into disjoint non-degenerate intervals, and
    using the rational number trick, we can prove that the number of those
    intervals must be countably infinite at most, so $Y$ turns out to be a Borel
    set. Hence, $f((a, b))$ is also a Borel set.

#solution[
  This is a direct consequence of the fact that $sum_(r in U) f(r) < infinity$
  for some $f: U -> (0, infinity)$ can only hold when $U$ is countable.

  The infinite sum is defined as
  $
    sum_(r in U) f(r) = sup_(U' subset.eq U\
    U' "countable") sum_(r in U') f(r).
  $

  Consider the set $U(epsilon) = {r in U: f(r) > epsilon}$. If there exists some
  $epsilon > 0$ such that $U(epsilon)$ is infinite, then

  $ sum_(r in U) f(r) >= sum_(r in U'') f(r) = infinity, $

  contradicts with the convergent of the infinite sum.

  Hence, the following set must be countably infinite at most.
  $ U' = union.big_(n in ZZ^+) U(1 / n), $

    infinity > mu(X) >= mu(union.big_(A in cal(A)) A) = sum_(A in cal(A)) mu(A) >

== Lebesgue Measure

#problem[
  + Show that the set consisting of those numbers in $(0, 1)$ that have a
    decimal expansion containing one hundred consecutive 4s is a Borel subset of
    $RR$.
  + What is the Lebesgue measure of this set?
]

#solution[
  + This set $S$ can be written as
    $
      union.big_(n = 0)^infinity 10^(-n) [0.underbrace(444..44, 100 "digits"),
        0.underbrace(444..4, 99 "digits")5]

  + Consider another set $T$ consisting of all numbers in $[0, 1]$ that have a
    digit with value $underbrace(444..44, 100 "digits")$ in its decimal
    expansion. This set can be easily seen as a subset of $S$.

    #lemma[
      Let $b$ be a positive number larger than 2 and $d$ be a digit in base-$b$
      ($0 <= d <= b - 1$). Then, the set of all numbers in $(0, 1)$ that have a
      decimal expansion containing the digit $d$ (after the decimal point) has
      Lebesgue measure $1$.
    ]

    #proof[
      Let $S_n$ be the set of all positive numbers in $(0, 1)$ that have a
      decimal expansion not containing the digit $d$ in the first $n$-th
      position after the decimal point.

      Chop up $(0, 1)$ into $b^n$ equal intervals with the same $n$ digits after
      the decimal point, and by a simple counting argument, $(b-1)^n$ of these
      intervals does not contain the digit $d$ in the first $n$-th positions.
      Hence, $|S_n| = (b-1)^n / b^n = (1 - 1 / b)^n$.

      Since our set is the complement of $S$, the intersection of all $S_n$, it
      must have a Lebesgue measure of at least $1 - (1 - 1 / b)^n$ for all $n >
      0$. Letting $n$ approach infinity, we acquire the desired result.
    ]

    Since $S$ has a subset with Lebesgue measure 1 and itself is a subset of
    another set ($(0, 1)$) with Lebesgue measure 1, $S$ must have Lebesgue
    measure 1.

  Let $A$ be any bounded non-Lebesgue-measurable set. Then there exists some
  $epsilon_0$ such that for every closed set $F subset.eq A$, $|A without F| >=

  epsilon_0$.

  simply scaling $A$ by a factor of $1 / epsilon_0$.

  Once again, let $V$ be any bounded non-Lebesgue-measurable set. Assuming $V$
  is bounded in $(0, 1)$, and there exists some $epsilon > 0$ such that $|G
  without V| > epsilon$ for all open supersets $G$ of $V$.

  Then, consider the set $A = union.big_(n in ZZ) (V + n)$. Any open
  superset $G$ of $A$ can be divided up into multiple $G_k = G sect (k, k + 1)
  supset.eq V + k, k in ZZ$
  that does not intersect any of $V + n$ with $k != n$. Hence, we can see
  that $G_k$ is an open set that contains $V + k$, so it must hold that:
  $ |G_k without (V + k)| >= epsilon. $

  Finally, we have
  $
    |G without A| = abs(union.big_(n in ZZ) (G_k without (V + k)))
    >= infinity dot epsilon = infinity.

  Here, we get around the subadditivity problem by considering that $G_k without

#solution[
  + Let $S = union.big_(I in cal(C)) I$ be such a set, where $cal(C)$ is a
    collection of nontrivial intervals.

    #let int(x) = [Int #x]
    Denote $int(X)$ as the interior of the set $X$, then we know that there
    exists some countable $cal(C') subset.eq cal(C)$ such that
    $ S' = union.big_(I in cal(C)) int(I) = union.big_(I in cal(C')) int(I), $
    from Theorem 0.59 of the MIRA supplement.

    Hence, our concern shifts to the boundary of the intervals in $cal(C)$.
    Without loss of generality, we will consider the right endpoints $x in S
    without S'$. Then, there has to be some $(alpha, x] in cal(C)$ or $[alpha, x] in
    cal(C)$ for some $alpha$ (the left endpoint and whether $alpha$ is contained
    in this range does not matter). We can get over the axiom of choice by
    imposing some sort of total ordering on the set $cal(C)$. Denote this
    interval as $I(x)$.

    Now, we can prove that $int(I(x)) sect int(I(y)) = diameter$ for all $x, y in S
    without S', x != y$. Otherwise, then without loss of generality, assuming
    that $int(I(x)) = (alpha, x), I(y) = (beta, y), x < y$, it must be the case that
    $beta < x < y$, so $x in int(I(y)) subset.eq S'$, a contradiction.

    Since $int(I(x))$'es are pairwise disjoint, we can establish a mapping from
    a subset of the rationals to ${int(I(x)): x in S without S'}$. Hence, the
    number of elements in $S without S'$ must be countable at most.

    Here, the argument does not change if we factor the left endpoints of
    intervals, since union of finitely many countable sets remains countable.

  $E sect (-t, t)$ as the disjoint union of countably many open intervals $I_k

  Consider the function
  $ g(x) = sum_(q_n in QQ) 1 / (4^n abs(x-q)), $

  This function can take the value $infinity$, so denote $X$ as the set of all
  $x in RR$ with $f(x) = infinity$. By @prob-borel-fn, we have $|{x
    in RR: f(x) >= 1}| <= 2$. However, this result can be generalize by taking
  $ A(beta) = union.big_(q_n in QQ) [q - beta^n, q + beta^n], $
  for some $beta in (0, 1)$. Then for every $x in.not A(beta)$,
  $ g(x) <= sum_(n = 1)^infinity 1 / ((4 beta)^n) = 1 / (4beta - 1) < infinity. $

  Measuring the set $RR without A(beta)$ yields $lambda(
    RR without
    A(alpha, beta)
  ) <= 2 sum_(n = 1)^infinity beta^n = beta / (beta - 1)$.
  Clearly, $X$ must be a subset of all $A(beta)$, so its measure must be smaller
  than $beta / (beta - 1)$ for all $beta > 0$. Hence, $|X| = 0$.

  Now, if we let $f = g chi_(RR without X)$, then $f = g$ at most points.
  Hence, the integral of $f$ on some interval $I$ takes the same value as that
  of $g$, which is
  $
    integral chi_I f dif lambda = integral chi_I g dif lambda = sum_(q_n
    in QQ) integral (chi_I (x)) / (4^n abs(x - q_n)) dif lambda.

  Suppose $f in cal(L)^1 (RR)$. Prove that

#solution[
  By the Lebesgue differentiation theorem and one of its corollaries,
  $ lim_(t -> 0^+) 1 / (2t) integral_(b-t)^(b+t) abs(f-f(b)) = 0 $
  and
  $ f(b) = lim_(t-> 0^+) f_([b-t, b+t]) $
  for almost every $b in RR$.

  Fix $b$ such that the two equalities hold.
  Then, for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists some $T$ such that:
  $ 1 / (2t) integral_(b-t)^(b+t) abs(f-f(b)) < epsilon / 2 $ and
  $ abs(f(b) - f_([b-t, b+t])) < epsilon / 2 $
  for every $0 < t < T$. Combining this yields
  $
    1 / (2t) integral_(b-t)^(b+t) abs(f-f_([b-t, b+t])) < 1 / (2t)
    integral_(b-t)^(b+t) (abs(f-f(b)) + abs(f(b) - f_([b-t, b+t]))) < epsilon
  $
  for all $0 < t < T$.

  Hence,
  $ lim_(t -> 0^+) 1 / (2t) integral_(b-t)^(b+t) abs(f-f_([b-t, b+t])) = 0. $.

#solution[
  Denote $J(b, t)$ as the set of all intervals with length $t$ containing $b$.
  Then,
  $
    sup_(I in J(b, t)) 1 / abs(I) integral_I abs(f-f_I) <= 1 / t sup_(I in J(b,

  The two terms both approach $0$ as $t->0^+$ for almost every $b in RR$:

  - $1 / t sup_(I in J(b, t)) integral_I |f-f(b)| <= 1 / t integral_(b-t)^(b+t)
    abs(f-f(b)) -> 0$ for almost every $b in RR$.

  Define $tilde(f)$ as:
  $ tilde(f) (x) = cases(0 "if" x > x_0, f(x) "otherwise"), $

  Hence, for every $x_0 in RR$, $tilde(f) in cal(L)^1 (RR)$. Applying the LDT to
  $tilde(f)$ yields that $g'(x) = f(x)$ for almost every $x < x_0$.

  Letting $x_0$ takes the value of a countable sequence to $infinity$ (e.g.

  Let $ E = union.big_(n = 0)^(infinity) [(1 / 3)^(2n+1), (1 / 3)^(2n)]. $

  Then,
  $
    abs(E sect (-(1 / 3)^(2k), (1 / 3)^(2k))) = sum_(n = k)^infinity
    abs([(1 / 3)^(2n+1), (1 / 3)^(2n)]) = sum_(n=k)^infinity 2 / 3 dot (1 / 9)^n = 1 / (12
    dot 9^k).

  As $k -> infinity$, we have:
  $
    lim_(k -> infinity) abs(E sect (-(1 / 3)^(2k), (1 / 3)^(2k))) / ((1 / 3)^(2k)) =
    1 / 12.
  $

  However, if one redo the calculation with $t = (1 / 3)^(2k+1)$, we have:
  $
    lim_(k -> infinity) abs(E sect (-(1 / 3)^(2k), (1 / 3)^(2k))) / ((1 / 3)^(2k+1)) =

  $E$ as the union of all such $I_n$'s.
  Then, we can calculate $d(t) = |E sect (-t, t)|$. Similarly to the previous
  example, we will only concern ourselves with the values of $d(t)$ when $t =
  1 / (n+1)$ and $t=1 / (n+1) +s / (n(n+1))$. The other values of $t$ are squeezed
  between them, and it is provable (albeit somewhat tedious) that only the two
  cases mentioned matter here.

  - $m(1 / (n+1)) = sum_(k = n + 1)^infinity s / (k(k+1)) = s / (n+1)$.
  - $m(1 / (n+1) + s / (n(n+1))) = sum_(k = n)^infinity s / (k(k+1)) = s / n$.

  Either way, the limit $(m(t)) / t$ both approaches $s$ as $n -> infinity$, so by
  letting $s = 1 / 3$, we have our desired example.

  Assuming $E$ is non-empty. For every $b in.not E$, we have:
  $
    0 = lim_(t->0^+) abs(E sect (x-t, x+t)) / (2t) = lim_(t->0^+) 1 / (2t)
    integral_(b-t)^(b+t) chi_E,
  $
  and from the inequality used in the proof of 4.19 (MIRA),
  the derivative of $G(x) = integral_a^x chi_(RR without E)$ at $b$ must be 0.
  Here $a$ is an arbitrary constant.

  Similarly, the derivative of $F(x) = integral_a^x chi_(E)$ at any $b in E$ must
  be 1, and since $F(x) + G(x) = x - a$ for all $x in RR$, we
  have $F'(x) = chi_E$ everywhere.

  For a given $b > a$, the Mean Value Theorem states that there exists some $c
  in (a, b)$ such that:
  $ chi_E (c) = F'(c) = (F(b)-F(a)) / (b-a) = (|E sect (a, b)|) / (b-a). $

  From this, either $abs(E sect (a, b)) = b - a$ or $0$ for every $b > a$.
  If $abs(E sect (a, b)) = 1$, then the density of every point in $(a, b)$ must
  be 1, which means $(a, b) subset.eq E$. Similarly, if $abs(E sect (a, b)) =
  0$, then $(a, b) subset.eq RR without E$.

  This is a bizarre set of conditions, which could only hold in the most trivial
  cases: $E = diameter$ or $E = RR$. Assuming otherwise, then there must be some
  $u in E$ and $v in.not E$, and letting $a = u - epsilon$ and $b = v + epsilon$
  clearly yield a contradiction: $(a, b)$ can't be in $E$ (it contains $v$) or
  in $RR without E$ (it contains $u$).

  Finally, to finish the proof, we need to prove that $Tc$ is a
  $sigma$-algebra, i.e. it is closed under complementation and countable union:
  - *Complementation*: If $E in Tc$ then ${x in X: (x, x) in (X times X)

  Then, $W$ contains all finite unions of measurable rectangles, so we will show
  that it is a monotone class:

  If $E_1 subset.eq E_2 subset.eq ...$ such that $E_n in W$, then
  $
    omega(union.big_(n = 1)^infinity E_n) = lim_(n -> infinity) omega(E_n) =

  not generally hold that $lim_(n -> infinity) omega(E_n) =
  omega(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n)$, so we need some special handling here.
  But note that if we are sure that $E_1$ has finite measure, then we have
  $
    omega(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n) = (mu times nu)(sect.big_(n =
      1)^infinity E_n).

  Let $Z_n$ be a sequence of subsets of $X times Y$ in $W$ (trivially
  constructable from measurable rectangles) such that $union.big_(n=1)^infinity

  where $union.sq.big$ denotes the disjoint union (implying the sets unioned are
  disjoint).

  Note that for every $m$, $(E_n sect Z_m) without hat(A)_m)$ is a decreasing
  sequence of sets with finite measure, so:
  $
    omega(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n) & = sum_(m=1)^infinity
                                         omega(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity ((E_n sect Z_m) without hat(A)_m)) \

                                             without hat(A)_m)).
  $
  Since this holds for all $omega$, it must also hold for $omega = mu times nu$
  as well, so this implies
  $
    omega(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n) = (mu times nu)(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity
      E_n).

  Hence, $W$ is a monotone class that contains the algebra of measurable
  rectangles, so it must contain the smallest $sigma$-algebra generated by these
  rectangles, $Sc ox Tc$.

#solution[
  We will prove a more general statement. If $norm(dot)_1$ and $norm(dot)_2$ are
  equivalent norms, then a set $G$ open w.r.t. $norm(dot)_1$ is also open w.r.t.
  $norm(dot)_2$. In MIRA, open sets are defined w.r.t. the $cal(l)_infinity$
  norm, which is equivalent to the $cal(l)_2$ norm used in the expression above.

  Let $G$ be an open set w.r.t. $norm(dot)_1$. Then, for every $x in G$, there
  exists some $r > 0$ such that $B(x, r, norm(dot)_1) = {y in RR^n:
    norm(x - y)_1 <r } subset.eq G$. Since $norm(dot)_1$ and $norm(dot)_2$ is
  equivalent, there exists some constant $C > 0$ such that:
  $ norm(x-y)_1 <= C norm(x-y)_2 <= r, forall y in B(x, r/C, norm(dot)_2), $
  so $B(x, r/C, norm(dot)_2) subset.eq B(x, r, norm(dot)_1) subset.eq G$.

  Let $E = {(x, x) in RR^2: x in V}$ for some

#problem[
  Suppose $(X, Sc), (Y, cal(T))$, and $(Z, cal(U))$ are measurable spaces.
  We can define $Sc ox Tc ox cal(U)$ to be the smallest $sigma$-algebra on
  $X times Y times Z$ that contains
  $ {A times B times C : A in S, B in T , C in U}. $
  Prove that if we make the obvious identifciations of the
  products $(X times Y) times Z$ and $X times (Y times Z)$ with $X times Y times
  Z$, then $ Sc ox Tc ox cal(U) = (Sc ox Tc ) ox cal(U) = Sc ox (Tc ox
    cal(U)). $
]

#solution[
  First, we prove $Sc ox Tc ox cal(U) = (Sc ox Tc ) ox cal(U)$. If $A in Sc, B
  in Tc, C in cal(U)$, then $A times B in Sc ox Tc$ and $(A times B) times C in
  (Sc ox Tc) ox cal(U)$. Hence, all generating elements of LHS is in RHS, so LHS
  must be a subset of RHS. The other direction is slightly complicated: if $A in
  Sc ox Tc$, $B in cal(U)$, then $A times B in Sc ox Tc ox cal(U)$.

  Fix $B in cal(U)$. Define $Xi = {A in Sc ox Tc: A times B in Sc ox Tc ox
    cal(U)}$. Clearly, $Xi$ contains all measurable rectangles in $X times Y$.
  If $A_1, A_2, ... in Xi$, then:
  $
    (union.big_(k = 1)^infinity A_k) times B = union.big_(k = 1)^infinity (A_k
      times B) in Sc ox Tc ox cal(U),
  $
  so $Xi$ is closed under countable union.

  Moreover, if $A in Xi$, then:
  $
    (X times Y without A) times B = (X times Y times B) without (A times B) in
    Sc ox Tc ox cal(U),
  $
  so $Xi$ is also closed under complementation.

  Hence, $Xi$ is a $sigma$-algebra containing all measurable rectangles of $X
  times Y$, so it must contains $Sc ox Tc$. Hence, for every $A in Sc ox Tc$ and
  $B in cal(U)$, $A times B in Sc ox Tc ox cal(U)$, implying $Sc ox Tc ox
  cal(U) supset.eq (Sc ox Tc) ox cal(U)$, the desired result.

  The other result can be derived similarly.

    $
  + If $f >= 0$, then let $f_1, f_2, ...$ be increasing simple functions that
    approximate $f$. Define the dilation $f'_k (x) = f_k (t x)$, and
    assuming $f_k = sum_(i = 1)^(n_k) c_(i, k) chi_A_(i, k)$, we have
    $
      f'_k (x) = sum_(i = 1)^(n_k) c_(i, k) chi_(A_(i, k)) (t x) = sum_(i = 1)^(n_k)
      c_(i, k) chi_(1/t A_(i, k)) (x).
    $
    Then,
    $
      integral_(RR^n) f'_k dif lambda_n & = sum_(i = 1)^(n_k) c_(i, k)

    $
    Hence, the dilation property works for every $f_k$. Then, by taking the limit
    and apply MCT, it also works for $f>=0$.

    The sets $(RR^m without F_1)$, $RR^n$, $RR^m$, $RR^n without F_2$ are all

  + First, we calculate $D_2 f$. If $(x, y) != (0, 0)$, then the derivative

    $ lim_(n -> infinity) d(f_n, g) <= lim_(n -> infinity) epsilon_n = 0, $
    hence $g = lim_(n->infinity) f_n$.

    For the reverse direction, if $g$ is the limit of $f_n in E$ as $n ->
    infinity$, then for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists some $n_0$ such that
    $d(f_n, g) < epsilon, forall n > n_0$. Then, $f_n in B(g, epsilon)$, so
    $B(g, epsilon) sect E != diameter$. Hence, $g in cs(E)$.
  + If $F$ is a closed subset that contains $E$, then we aim to prove $cs(E)
    subset.eq F$. This is equivalent to proving that every $g in cs(E)$ is
    also in $F$.
    Assuming $g in.not F$, then $g in V without F$, an open set. Then, there
    exists some $epsilon > 0$ such that $B(g, epsilon) subset.eq V without F$.
    Hence, $B(g, epsilon) sect E subset.eq (V without F) sect E = diameter$,
    which contradicts the definition
    of $g in cs(E)$. Hence, $g in F$, and therefore $cs(E) subset.eq F$.
  + Let $g in V without cs(E)$. Assuming $exists.not epsilon > 0$ such that
    $B(g, epsilon) subset.eq V without cs(E)$, then $forall epsilon > 0, B(g,
      epsilon) sect cs(E) != diameter$. However, this implies $g in cs(E)$, a
    contradiction. Hence, there always exists $epsilon > 0$ such that $B(g,
      epsilon) subset.eq V without cs(E)$, so $V without cs(E)$ is open, hence
    $cs(E)$ is closed.
  + If $cs(E) = E$ then $E = cs(E)$ is clearly closed. Assuming $E$ is closed,
    then $cs(E)$ is contained in every closed $F supset.eq E$. Taking $F = E$
    gives $cs(E) subset.eq E$. But since $E subset.eq cs(E)$ from definition, we
    must have $E = cs(E)$.
  + This is a trivial consequence of the first and fourth statements.

#problem[
  Prove that each open subset of a metric space $V$ is the union of some
  sequence of closed subsets of $V$.
]

#solution[
  #let dist = math.op("dist")
  Let $E subset.eq V$ be an open set. Define:
  $ F_n = { x in E: dist(x, V without E) >= 1/n }, $
  where $dist(x, Y) = inf_(y in Y) d(x, y)$ is the distance from $x$ to a set
  $Y$.

  Then, if $x in E$, there must be some $epsilon > 0$ such that $B(x, epsilon)
  subset.eq E$. Hence, $dist(x, V without E) >= epsilon > 0$. That way, there
  exists some $n in ZZ^+$ such that $dist(x, V without E) >= 1/n$, hence $x in
  F_n$. Hence, we can see that:
  $ union.big_(n = 1)^infinity F_n = E. $

  Now, it suffices to prove that $F_n$ are closed for every $n$.
  Let $f_k$ be a convergent sequence in $F_n$ with limit $f$. Then,
  note that for every $x, y in V, Y subset.eq V$, we have:
  $ abs(dist(x, V) - dist(y, V)) <= d(x, y). $
  To see this, denote $d_1 = dist(x, Y), d_2 = dist(y, V)$, then for every
  $epsilon > 0$, there exists
  sequences $a_epsilon in Y$ such that:
  $ d(x, a_epsilon) <= d_1 + epsilon $
  Then,
  $ d(x, y) >= d(x, a_epsilon) + d(a_epsilon, y) >= d_1- d_2 + epsilon. $
  Similarly,
  $ d(x, y) >= d_2 - d_1 + epsilon. $
  Since both inequalities hold for every $epsilon > 0$, we have:
  $ d(x, y) >= abs(d_1 - d_2) = abs(dist(x, Y) - dist(y, Y)). $

  With this, $dist(x, Y)$ is continuous w.r.t. $x$, so we have:
  $
    dist(f, V without E) = lim_(k -> infinity) dist(f_k, V without E) <=
    1/n.
  $
  Hence, $f in F_n$, which means $F_n$ is closed.

  Therefore, $E$ is the union of closed sets.

  - (c) is equivalent to (a):
    - If $T$ is continuous, and $G$ is an open set,
      we will prove that $T^(-1)$ is also open. Let $x in
      T^(-1) (G)$, then $T(x) in G$, and there exists
      some $epsilon > 0$ such that $B(T(x), epsilon) subset.eq G$, and $delta > 0$ such
      that $d(T(x), T(x')) < epsilon$, or equivalently, $T(x') in B(T(x), epsilon))
      subset.eq G$, for every $x' in B(x, delta)$. Hence, $B(x, delta) subset.eq
      T^(-1) (G)$, which implies $T^(-1) (G)$ is open.
    - If $T^(-1) (G)$ is open for every open $G$, then for every $f in V,
      epsilon > 0$, $T^(-1) (B(T(f), epsilon))$ is open. Hence, there exists
      $delta > 0$ such that $B(f, delta) subset.eq T^(-1) (B(T(f), epsilon))$, which
      implies $d(T(f), T(g)) < epsilon, forall g in V, d(f, g) < delta$.
  - (a) implies (b): Let $f_n in V$ be a convergent sequence with limit $f$.
    Then, since $T$ is continuous, for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists $delta
    > 0$ such that $d(T(f), T(g)) < epsilon, forall g in B(f, delta)$. Since
    $f_n -> f$ as $n -> infinity$, there exists $k$ such that $d(f_n, f) < delta,
    forall n > k$. Then, $d(T(f), T(f_n)) < epsilon, forall n > k$. Hence,
    $lim_(n -> infinity) T(f_n) = T(f)$.

  - If $x_n$ is a Cauchy sequence, then $d(x_m, x_n) < 1/2, forall m, n >= N$ for
    some $N$. This is equivalent to $x_m = x_n, forall m, n >= N$, so $x_n ->
    x_N$ as $n -> infinity$.
  - This is an elementary result from Real Analysis. For large $n$, $x_n$ is
    bounded in some $B(x_N, epsilon)$. Then, $x_n$ has a convergent subsequence.
    By @prob:cauchy-converge-subseq, $x_n$ must be convergent.
  - If $x^m$ is a Cauchy sequence (use superscript to avoid the subscripts for
    the index of each vector), then $x^m_k$ is a Cauchy sequence (fix $n$ and
    let $k in [n]$). Then, we can let each component be the real number limit of
    its respective component sequence, if that makes sense.
  - If $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence, then $f_n (x)$ is also a Cauchy sequence in
    the usual $RR$ metric space. Hence, $lim_(n -> infinity) f_n (x)$ exists,
    and therefore $f_n$ converges to some $f$ pointwise. But since $f_n$ are
    uniformly continuous on $[0, 1]$, $f$ must be continuous on $[0, 1]$, so $f in
    C([0, 1])$.
  - If $a^k$ is a Cauchy sequence (of sequences in $cal(l)^1$, and we use
    superscript to avoid the subscripts for the index of each sequence), then
    every $a^k_n$ (fix $n$ and let $k in ZZ^+$) is a Cauchy sequence. Hence, we
    can define the pointwise limit $a$ of $a^k$. Now, for all large $k$, we have:
    $
      d(a^k_n, a) < "some" epsilon => sum_(n=1)^infinity abs(a_n) <= sum_(n=1)^infinity
      abs(a^k_n) + sum_(n=1)^infinity abs(a_n - a^k_n) < infinity,

  The last two statements are just the creams of the crop and extremely trivial.
  We will only prove the first 3 statements.
  + If $f equiv g$ and $f equiv h$, then:
    $ d(g_k, h_k) <= d(f_k, g_k) + d(f_k, h_k) 0 "as" k -> infinity, $
    so $g equiv h$.
  + This proof has three subsections:
    - First, we will prove that the limit exists for. Define:
      $ f(k) = sup_(m, n >= k) d(f_m, f_n). $
      Then, we have:
      $
        d(f_k, g_k) <= d(f_k, f_K) + d(g_k, g_K) + d(f_K, g_K) <= f(K) + g(K) +
        d(f_K, g_K),
      $
      for all $k >= K$. Hence $d(f_k, g_k)$ is closed, therefore it has a
      convergent subsequence $d(f_k_n, g_k_n) -> d$. Replace $K$ by $k_n$ and letting
      $n -> infinity$ gives
      $ d(f_k, g_k) <= f(k_n) + g(k_n) + d(f_k_n, g_k_n) -> d. $ <eq:asdf1>
      Moreover, we have:
      $ d(f_k, g_k) >= d(f_k_n, g_k_n) - (f(k) + g(k)) $
      Letting $n -> infinity$ gives
      $ d(f_k, g_k) >= d - (f(k) + g(k)), $
      and $k -> infinity$ gives
      $ liminf_(k->infinity) d(f_k, g_k) >= d. $ <eq:asdf2>
      From @eq:asdf1 and @eq:asdf2, we have $lim_(k -> infinity) d(f_k, g_k) = d$.

    - We will then prove that $d_V$ is well defined: if $v, v' in hat(v), w, w' in
      hat(w)$ for some $hat(v), hat(w) in V$, then
      $ lim_(k -> infinity) d(v_k, w_k) = lim_(k -> infinity) d(v'_k, w'_k). $
      WLOG assuming $w = w'$ (why?). What we need to prove is simply,
      $ lim_(k->infinity) abs(d(v_k,w_k)-d(v'_k,w_k)) = 0, $
      which is true since the limit term is bounded above by $abs(d(v_k,v'_k))$.

    - Now, we prove that $d$ defined this way is a metric space, of which the
      nontrivial part is the triangle inequality. However, note that if $u, v, w
      in U$, then:
      $
        d_V (u hat, v hat) & = lim_(k -> infinity) d(u_k, v_k)          \
                           & <= liminf_(k ->
                             infinity) (d(u_k, w_k) + d(v_k, w_k))      \
                           & = d_V (u hat, w hat) + d_V (v hat, w hat).
      $
  + If $u^n hat in U$ is a Cauchy sequence, i.e.
    $
      lim_(N -> infinity) underbrace(
        sup_(m, n >= N) lim_(k -> infinity)
        d(u^m_k, u^n_k), g(N)
      ) = 0,
    $
    then since every $u^n$ is a Cauchy sequence, there exists $K_n$ such that
    $ d(u^n_i, u^n_j) < 1/n, forall i, j >= K_n. $
    Define $ u_n = u^n_K_n, $
    then we will prove that:
    - $u_n$ is a Cauchy sequence: Let $epsilon > 0$, there exists $K$ such that
      $d_V (u^m, u^n) < epsilon/3, forall m, n > K$. Then, there exists $K'$
      such that $d(u^m_k, u^n_k) < epsilon/3, forall k > K'$.

      Then, for any $k > max{K', K_m, K_n}$, we have:
      $
        d(u_m, u_n) & = d(u^m_K_m, u^n_K_n)      \
                    & <= d(u^m_K_m, u^m_k) + d(u^n_K_n,
                        u^n_k) + d(u^m_k, u^n_k) \
                    & <= 1/m + 1/n + epsilon/3.
      $

      Adding an additional constraint that $m, n > 3/epsilon$ gives $d(u_m, u_n)
      < epsilon$. Hence, if $m, n > max{K, 3/epsilon}$, then $d(u_m, u_n) <
      epsilon$, so $u$ is a Cauchy sequence.
    - $u^m$ converges to $u$. This is equivalent to proving $ lim_(m ->
      infinity) d_V (u^m, u) = lim_(m -> infinity) lim_(n -> infinity) d
      (u^m_n, u_n) = lim_(m -> infinity) lim_(n -> infinity) d
      (u^m_n, u^n_K_n) = 0. $
      We have
      $
        d(u^m_n, u^n_K_n) & <= d(u^m_n, u^m_K_n) + d(u^m_K_n, u^n_K_n) \
                          & <= 1/n + d_V (u^m, u^n),
      $
      so
      $
        d_V (u^m, u) <= sup_(n >= m) (1/n + d_V (u^m, u^n)) = sup_(n >= m)
        d_V (u^m, u^n).
      $
      But since $u$ is a Cauchy sequence, we must have:
      $ lim_(m -> infinity) sup_(n >= m) d_V (u^m, u^n) = 0, $
      which gives us the desired result.
      Hence, we have proven that every Cauchy sequence $(u^m)$ converges.
      Therefore, $V$ is complete.

#solution[
  Since every subspace of $V$ contains the zero vector, the intersection of
  every collection of subspaces must also contains that vector and therefore is
  nonempty.

  If $W = sect.big_(tau in Pi) V_tau$ for subspaces $V_tau subset.eq V, forall
  tau in Pi$, then if $u, v in W$, $alpha, beta in CC$, we have:
  $ u, v in V_tau => alpha u + beta v in V_tau, forall tau in Pi. $

#solution[
  We know that $cs(B(f, r)) subset.eq cs(B)(f, r)$, so it suffices to prove that
  for every $y in cs(B)(f, r)$, $y in cs(B(f, r))$. Since $y in cs(B)(f, r)$,
  $norm(x-y) <= r$. Define $y_n = x + (y - x) (1 - 1/n)$, then
  $ norm(x-y_n) = (1-1/n) norm(x-y) < r, forall n > 0. $
  Hence, $y_n in B(f, r)$ for every $n in ZZ^+$, which implies its limit,
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) y_n = y in cs(B(f, r)). $
  Hence, $cs(B(f, r)) supset.eq cs(B)(f, r)$.

  To prove completeness, consider a Cauchy sequence of bounded functions $f_n$.
  For every $x in X$, we have:

  Hence, $f_m (x)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $FF$ (with fixed $x$), so there
  exists a limit
  $ f(x) = lim_(n -> infinity) f_n (x). $

  Clearly, $f$ defined this way is the limit of $f_n$. Then, it suffices to
  prove that $f in b(X)$. First, note that:
  $ norm(f) <= norm(f_n) + norm(f - f_n), forall n in ZZ^+. $
  For large $n$, we have $norm(f-f_n)$ is finite, and since $f_n in b(X)$, its

  Assuming $U$ is a nonempty, proper subset of $V$ that is both closed and open.
  Take $x in U$ and $y in V without U$. Aside from some trivial cases, we can

  construct a sequence of $lambda$ values in the set mentioned above that
  approaches $lambda_1$, so by the closedness of $U$, we must have $f(lambda_1)
  in U$.

  Consider an open ball centered at $f(lambda_1)$. Clearly we can see this set
  intersect both $U$ and $V without U$, so $f(lambda_1)$ belongs to the boundary

#solution[
  + Homogeneity is trivial, so we only need to care about the triangle
    inequality and positive definiteness.
    We have the triangle equality:
    $
      inf_(h in U) norm(f + g + h) & = inf_(h_1, h_2 in U) (norm(f + h_1) +
        norm(g+h_2)) \
      & <= inf_(h_1 in U) norm(f + h_1) + inf_(h_2 in U) norm(f + h_2)
      &= norm(f + U) + norm(g + U) .
    $

    Now, consider positive definiteness. If $norm(f + U) = 0$, then there exists
    $g_1, g_2, ... in U$  such that $norm(f + g_n) -> 0$ as $n -> infinity$.
    This implies $g_n -> -f$ as $n -> infinity$. Then, $f + U = U$ only if $f$
    actually belongs to $U$,  which must happen when $U$ is closed.

    Now, assuming $U$ is not closed, so where can pick $f in cs(U) without U$,
    and there exists a sequence $g_n in U$ such that $norm(f + g_n) -> 0$ as
    $n -> infinity$. Then, we have $f + U != U$, but $norm(f + U) = 0$, a
    contradiction.
  + Let $f_n + U$ be a sequence such that:
    $ sum_(n=1)^infinity norm(f_n + U) < infinity , $
    then we aim to prove that:
    $ sum_(n=1)^infinity (f_n + U) = sum_(n=1)^(infinity) f_n + U "converges". $
    Now, observe that:
    $
      norm(f_n + U) = inf_(u in U) norm(f_n + u),
    $
    so we can pick $u_(m, n) in U$ such that:
    $ norm(f_n + u_(m,n)) <= norm(f_n + U) + 1/2^m, forall m, n in ZZ^+. $

    Then, we have:
    $
      sum_(n = 1)^infinity norm(f_n + u_(n, n)) <= sum_(n=1)^(infinity) norm(
        f_n +
        U
      ) + 1 < infinity .
    $
    By this, we have $g_n = f_n + u_(n, n)$ such that $sum_(n=1)^(infinity)
    g_n < infinity$.

    But since $u_(n, n) in U$, we have $f_n + U = g_n + U$. Then,
    $
      sum_(n=1)^(infinity) (f_n + U) = sum_(n=1)^(infinity) (g_n + U) =
      sum_(n=1)^(infinity) g_n + U.
    $
    Hence, the series $sum_(n=1)^(infinity) (f_n + U)$ converges, which implies
    $V qt U$ is a Banach space.
  + Let $f_n in V$ be a Cauchy sequence on $V$, then $f_n + U$ is also Cauchy on
    $V qt U$:
    $
      norm((f_n+U)-(f_m+U)) & = norm((f_n - f_m) + U)                     \
                            & = inf_(u in U) norm(
                                f_n -
                                f_m + u
                              )                                           \
                            & <= inf_(u in U) (norm(f_n - f_m) + norm(u)) \
                            & = norm(f_n - f_m) .
    $
    Hence, $f_n + U$ converges to some $f + U$ in $V qt U$. Then,
    $ norm((f_n + U) - (f + U)) = inf_(u in U) norm((f_n - f) + u). $
    so there exists $v_n in U$ such that:
    $ norm((f_n - f) + v_n) < 1/n, forall n in ZZ^+. $

    Take any $epsilon > 0$, we have:
    $
      norm(v_n - v_m) & <= norm(v_n + (f_n - f)) + norm(v_m + (f_m - f)) +
                        norm(f_n - f_m)                 \
                      & <= 1/n + 1/m + norm(f_n - f_m).
    $

  Hence, if we take $m, n > K$ such that $1/n + 1/m + norm(f_n - f_m)$, we can
  have $norm(v_n-v_m) < epsilon$. Hence, $v_n$ is a Cauchy sequence, therefore
  converges to some $v in U$. Then, we have:
  $ norm((f_n - f) + v) <= norm((f_n - f) + v_n) + norm(v_n - v) -> 0, $
  as $n -> infinity$. Hence, $f_n$ converges to $f - v$.

#solution[
  Basically we need to prove all norms on $FF^n$ are equivalent. One direction
  is trivial enough:
  $
    x = sum_(k=1)^(n) x_k e_k in FF^n => norm(x) <= sum_(k=1)^(n)
    abs(x_k) norm(e_k) <= norm(x)_infinity sum_(k=1)^n norm(e_k), forall x in
    FF^n.
  $
  This also implies that $norm(dot)$ is continuous w.r.t. the $cal(l)_infinity$
  norm. This implies that there is some $x_0 in partial B(0, 1)$ such that:
  $ 0 < norm(x_0) <= norm(x), forall x in partial B(0, 1). $
  Then, we have:
  $
    norm(x) = norm(x)_infinity norm(x/norm(x)_infinity) >= norm(x)_infinity
    norm(x_0), forall x in FF^n without {0}.
  $
  This gives the remaining direction we need.

#solution[
  Let $C = {x_1, x_2, ...}$ be a countable dense subset of $V$ and $f$ be a
  bounded linear functional on some subspace $U$. Then, we can
  inductively construct a sequence of linear functionals $(f_n)$
  via the Extension Lemma:
  $
    f_n: A_n = span (U union {x_1, ..., x_n}) -> FF,\
    f_n "agrees with" f_(n-1) "on" A_(n-1), norm(f_n) = norm(f_(n-1)).
  $

  Taking the pointwise limit of this sequence, we can define a linear functional
  $
    tilde(f) -> A = union_(n=1)^infinity A_n -> FF,\
    tilde(f)(x) = lim_(n -> infinity) f_n (x)
  $
  on a dense subspace $A$ of $V$.

  Finally, by denseness, we can extend this functional to the whole space $V$,
  via:
  $ hat(f)(x) = tilde(f)(a_n), "for any" a_n -> x, a_n in A. $
  The only non-trivial thing left is proving that this construction is
  well-defined, i.e. if $a_n, b_n -> x$ for some sequences $a_n, b_n in A$, then
  the limits must coincide:
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) tilde(f)(a_n) = lim_(n -> infinity) tilde(f)(b_n). $
  This clearly holds as:
  $
    abs(tilde(f)(a_n) - tilde(f)(b_n)) = abs(tilde(f)(a_n - b_n)) <= M norm(
      a_n
      - b_n

  $
  for some constant $M$. The right-hand side goes to $0$ as $n -> infinity$, so
  the limits coincide and our definition of $hat(f)$ is well-defined.

  linear functional $phi$ on $V$ with norm 1.

  Consider the point evaluation functionals $phi_x: C([0, 1])' -> FF$ defined by

  piecewise-linear function that maximizes $abs(f(x)-f(y))$ to a value of 2 for

  If $phi_x, phi_y in N_s$, then we have:
  $ norm(phi_x - phi_y) <= norm(phi_x - s) + norm(phi_y - s) < 2, $

  Let $f$ be an unbounded linear functional from $V$ to $RR$. For any convex $C

    since $f(z) = lambda f(x) + (1 - lambda) f(y) in C$.
  - $S$ is dense in $V$ (assuming that $S$ is non-empty): take some $y in V$.
    Then, we
    want to find some $x in S$ such that $norm(y-x) < epsilon$ for any given
    $epsilon > 0$. This is equivalent to finding $z = y - x$ such that $f(z) =
    f(y) - f(x) = c$ (here we fix $f(x) = t$ for some $t in C$) and $norm(z) <
    epsilon$.

    Since $f$ is unbounded, we can find $w$ with $norm(w) = 1$ and $f(w) > M$.
    Rescaling gives a $u$ with $norm(u) < epsilon$ and $f(u) > c$. Defining $v =
    c/f(u) u$ gives the desired value for $z$.

      delta)$, so
    $ abs(f(y)-f(z)) < 1/n, forall y, z in B(x', delta/2). $
    Hence, $x' in G_n$, and therefore $B(x, delta) subset.eq G_n$.

    To conclude, since $C$ is a countable intersection of open subsets of $RR$,
    its intersection can't be $QQ$. Hence, such a function $f$ could not exist.

#solution[
  Denote $F_k = X without G_k$. Then, the problem is equivalent to proving
  $ F = union.big_(k=1)^infinity F_k $
  is a subset of $X$ with empty interior.

  Assuming otherwise, then there exists some $f in int F$, which implies
  $exists r > 0: B(f, r) subset.eq F$.

  To conclude, simply consider:
  $ F'_k = F_k sect B(f, r) $
  in the complete metric space $(B(f, r), d)$. We have:
  $ B(f, r) = F sect B(f, r) = union.big_(k=1)^infinity F'_k, $
  while each $F'_k$ is a closed subset of $B(f, r)$ with empty interior (in this
  new metric space). This contradicts Baire's theorem.

#solution[
  If $B = {b_1, b_2, ...}$ is a countable basis of an infinite-dimensional
  Banach space $V$, then we have:
  $ V = union.big_(k=1)^infinity underbrace(span {b_1, ..., b_k}, V_k), $
  where each $V_k$ is closed (@prob:fin-subspace-closed) and has empty interior
  (which we'll prove here).

  Assuming $V_k$ has an interior point $x$, then we can easily construct some
  $y_t = x + t v$ such that $y in.not V_k, forall t != 0$, by, for example,
  taking $v = b_(k + 1)$. The existence of such $y_t$ clearly contradicts the
  interior point assumption, so $V_k$ has empty interior.

  Then, we clearly have a contradiction to Baire's theorem, so $B$ could not
  exist.

#solution[
  Consider $V = W = C([0, 1])$ with $norm(dot)_V = norm(dot)_infinity$,
  $norm(dot)_W =
  norm(dot)_1$ and $T$ be the identity map. Then, we can see that $T$ is
  surjective and bounded (operator norm is at most 1). Clearly $W$ is not a
  Banach space.

  Now, we will prove that $G = B_infinity (0, 1)$ is not open in $W$. Assuming
  thst $0$ is
  an interior point of $G$, then there exists some $r > 0$ such that $B_1 (0, r)
  subset.eq G = B_infinity (0, 1)$. This implies that $norm(dot)_1$ and
  $norm(dot)_infinity$ are equivalent, so by this logic, $W$ must be a Banach
  space, a contradiction.

#solution[
  Consider any Banach space $W$ and a normed vector space $V$ with the norm:
  $ norm(x)_V = norm(x)_W + abs(omega(x)), $
  for some discontinuous linear functional $omega$ on $W$.

  Once again, take $T$ as the identity map, which is surjective.
  Then, since $norm(x)_V <= norm(x)_W$ for all $x in W$, $T$ has operator norm
  at most 1, hence bounded.

  To conclude, we simply take $G = B_V (0, 1)$, which is open in $V$. We simply
  want to prove that $G$ is not open in $W$. Assuming that $B_W (0, r) subset.eq
  B_V (0, 1)$, then for every $x in W, norm(x)_W < r$, we must have:
  $ norm(x)_V = norm(x)_W + abs(omega(x)) < 1. $

  Now, it suffices to find some $x in B_W (0, r)$ such that $abs(omega(x)) >=
  1$, or $x in W$ such that $abs(omega(x)) >= 2 dot norm(x)/r$, by
  normalization. Clearly, this is achievable as $omega$ is unbounded.

  Banach space $W$. Prove that $T$ is bounded below if and only if $T$ is
  injective and the range of $T$ is a closed subspace of $W$.
]

#solution[
  - If $T$ is bounded below, then $norm(T x) > 0$ for every $x != 0$. This
    implies that $T x = 0$ only when $x = 0$, so $T$ is injective. Assuming that
    there is a sequence $T(x_1), T(x_2), ...$ in some subspace $S$ that
    converges to some $y^* in W$, then we will prove that $y^* in S$. Note that
    $ norm(T(x_i) - T(x_j)) >= 1/c norm(x_i - x_j), $
    so if $T(x_n)$ (is a Cauchy sequence and therefore) converges, then so does $x_i$.
    Then, we can see that $y^* = T(lim_(n -> infinity ) (x_n)) in S$.
  - If $T$ is injective and the range of $T$ is a closed subspace of $W$, then
    by taking the inverse of $T$ on the range, we get a bounded linear map
    $T^(-1)$ (by the Bounded Inverse Theorem). Then, we have:
    $
      norm(x) = norm(T^(-1)(T(x))) <= norm(T^(-1)) norm(T(x)).
    $
    This implies that $T$ is bounded below.

  We use the same spaces as in @prob:omt-counter1. Clearly if $T$ is the

  However, the inverse map $T^(-1)$ is not bounded, as we can see:

  $ sup {norm(T f): T in cal(A) } = sup_(k in ZZ^+) norm(T_k f) < infinity. $
  By the Principal of Uniform Boundedness, we have that $sup {norm(T): T in

]

#solution[
  Consider the map $S: W' -> V'$ defined by $S(phi) = phi compose T$. Then, we
  can see that the graph of $S$ is closed, i.e. if $phi_n -> phi, S(phi_n) ->
  psi$, then $psi = S(phi)$. This is true, as for every $f in W$ with $norm(f)
  <= 1$,
  $
    psi(f) = lim_(n -> infinity) S(phi_n) (f) = lim_(n -> infinity) phi_n (T f)
    = phi(T f) = S(phi)(f).
  $
  Hence, $S$ is a bounded linear map.
  Then, for any $f in V$, we have:
  $
    norm(T f) & = sup {abs(phi(T f)), phi in W', norm(phi) = 1 } \
              & = sup {S(phi) (f), phi in W', norm(phi) = 1 }    \
              & <= norm(S) norm(f).
  $
  Hence, $T$ is bounded.
